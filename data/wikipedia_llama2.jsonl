{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Salesbury\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Salesbury is a village and civil parish in Ribble Valley, located centrally in the county of Lancashire, England. The B6245 road runs straight through the village providing transport links to towns such as Blackburn, Preston and Burnley. Salesbury lies less than 5 miles north of Blackburn and approximately 2 miles south of the River Ribble.\n\nCopster Green is an area of houses a little north of Salesbury.\n\nHistory \nSalesbury is first recorded as a chapelry in the ancient parish of Blackburn but in 1866 it became a civil parish. The Old English name of the village is 'Salebyry', dating from 1246 AD and 'Salewelle' dating from 1296 AD. This means 'burh by Sale Wheel' (burh is an Old English word meaning fortress). Sale Wheel is the name of a pool in the River Ribble where the river winds, contracts and foams over huge rocks and boulders within the channel and means \"pool where willows grow\". Wheel comes from the Anglo-Saxon word \"weal\" meaning a whirlpool.\n\nThe church \nInitially there was no church in Salesbury, so devout landowners of the village often had private chapels. It is known that Salesbury Old Hall and Showley Hall are two of the places that housed chapels. These could be attended by tenants and servants, but for baptisms, marriages and burials people went to nearby churches in Blackburn and Ribchester. These were the Parish Church of St. Mary in Blackburn and St Wilfrid's Church, Ribchester.\n\nAs the population of Salesbury grew towards the end of the 18th Century as a result in a boom in weaving, Viscount Bulkeley and other landowners raised the money to build a Chapelry. St. Peter's Chapelry was built and consisted of a rectangular room with a bell, a chimney and a porch. It was consecrated on 8 September 1807 by the Lord Bishop of Chester. The Chapelry served its purpose for many years until 1848, when a report by the Rural Dean of Blackburn described the old church as 'having been originally very ill-built, and, in its present condition, inconvenient, uncouth, unchurchlike and ruinous.'. The building was propped up, and church life went on as usual.\n\nIn 1873 a new vicar Rev. Peter Hopwood Hart arrived and set up a committee to raise money for a new church. The old chapelry was removed and a church was re-built in the same position. The church was finally consecrated on 29 June 1887. It was known as the Jubilee Church as it was built in the year of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. It was built in a 'late 14th-century Gothic' design by the architects Stones & Gradwell.\n\nThe church is one of the main features in Salesbury. It boasts stained glass windows, an organ and a regular choir. The church has a graveyard which surrounds the church and includes spaces for both gravestones and cremation plaques. The current incumbent is the Reverend Elizabeth M. McLean.\n\nPopulation\n\n1881\u20131961 census\nThe population of Salesbury has fluctuated throughout time. The 1881 census records the population to be 184 people. This was spread over 1,150 acres of land and there were thought to be 58 houses. The chapelry was so small that the residents post was sent to the local town of Blackburn where it needed to be collected. As time went on the population reached a peak in the 1930s at 350 people and begun to plateau at around an average population of 300 around 1950. This did not follow the general trend of the UK as the 1930s mostly saw a low rate of population increase. Similarly as World War II ended and marriages boomed the population also increased in to peak in the 1960s. This can be seen to a small extent on the graph but there was not a significant population change in Salesbury.\n\n2001\u20132011 census\nMuch of the modern village of Salesbury lies within Clayton-le-Dale parish, the main centre of population in Salesbury being Copster Green. At the 2001 UK census, the parish had a population of 391, with 1,142 in Clayton-le-Dale, whereas the 2011 UK census recorded populations of 403 and 1,128 respectively. Clayton-le-Dale is situated further down the same road and is approximately the same size if a little bigger than Salesbury, so it could be interpreted that by halving the figure a rough estimate of the population could be achieved. In the same area there were 624 houses recorded which by the same logic still shows a significant increase from the early figures of 58 houses. This increase could be due to the people who are tempted away from big towns and cities as a result of the 'rural idyll'\n\nEmployment\n\n1881 census \nIn the census carried out in 1881 55% of men were employed either in agriculture (29%) or working with mineral substances (26%). These high levels of manual labour are typical of the time. At the other end of the scale the least popular forms of employment were as professionals (2%), as workers in food and lodging (3%) or in transport and communication (3%). As it could be expected the majority of women worked in domestic services or offices (22%) or in textiles and fabrics (22%). Many women were employed by the weaving trade, this was also responsible for a boom in the population towards the end of the 18th century as the craft became more popular.\n\n2001 census \nThe United Kingdom Census 2001 shows a change in the types on employment in the village. The two main forms of employment are manufacturing (17%) and wholesale and retail trade (18%). It is clear that manufacturing can still be seen as a form of manual labour suggesting little change. But the increase in employment in retail and trade follows with the retail trends of the 21st century. In contrast, previously popular employment such as Fishing, Mining and quarrying all currently employ no one in the village. This shows a shift from primary employment to secondary and tertiary forms of employment.\n\nAmenities \nThere are few local amenities in the village of Salesbury as the small size of the settlement and the proximity to Blackburn means that residents can easily access services elsewhere. The village's amenities include; a public house, a memorial hall, a primary school, a cricket club and of course the church.\n\nThe Bonny Inn \nThe Bonny Inn pub is situated in the southern part of the village on Ribchester road. It is described as a 'traditional family pub' according to The Good Pub Guide. The bar is home to 5 real ales and wines from all over the world. The pub also has a patio which boasts panoramic views of Ribble Valley.\n\nThe Memorial Hall \n\nSalesbury Memorial Hall is located on Ribchester Road in Salesbury. It is intended for the use of the inhabitants of the village, This includes meetings, classes and leisure activities. Last years income was \u00a313,552 whilst the expenditure was \u00a310,941 leaving a profit of \u00a32.611 for the hall. The grounds surrounding and near to the Memorial Hall belong to the Wilpshire Wanderers under 5 to under 10 football teams. The ground opened in 2002 by former Blackburn and England favourite Ronnie Clayton (footballer). Ronnie was also the Honorary President of Wilpshire Wanderers Football Club until he died in 2010.\n\nSalesbury School \nSalesbury school is a mixed primary school which caters for children from ages 3\u201311. The school has 9 classes in total not including the nursery, this adds up to a total of 275 full-time pupils and 45 part-time pupils.\n\nSalesbury Cricket Club \nThe cricket club (Salesbury CC) was founded in 1906, and the team initially played in the Blackburn Sunday school league. It boasts both junior and adult sections. The junior section consists of U9, U11, U13, U15 and U18 teams, and is credited with E.C.B. Clubmark Status, This shows the high quality and standard of the club. There are three adult teams, 1st, 2nd and 3rd's.\n\nSee also\n\nListed buildings in Salesbury\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nGoogle Earth view: Salesbury & Copster Green\n\nVillages in Lancashire\nCivil parishes in Lancashire\nGeography of Ribble Valley", "machine_text": " Salesbury is a small town located in the county of Wiltshire, England.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Maurice Eustace (Lord Chancellor)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Sir Maurice Eustace (c. 1590 \u2013 22 June 1665) was an Irish  landowner, politician, barrister  and judge of the seventeenth century who spent the last years of his career as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. This was an office for which he felt himself to be entirely unfit,  and in which he was universally agreed to be a failure.\n\nFamily background\nEustace was born in about 1590, at Castlemartin, County Kildare, eldest of the three sons of John FitzWilliam Eustace, Constable of Naas (died 1623). Little is known of his mother, whose name is thought to be Catherine d'Arcy. Of  his sisters, one sister, whose name is variously given as Elizabeth or Elinor, married Edmund Keating and had two sons, Oliver and John Keating, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, while  another, Alice, married Robert Cusack of Rathgar  Castle, but was  apparently not  the mother of his son Adam Cusack. \n\nThe Eustaces of Castlemartin were a branch of the prominent \"Old English\"  FitzEustace family who held the title Viscount Baltinglass, but unlike their Baltinglass cousins, the Castlemartin branch of the Eustace family played no part in the Desmond Rebellions of the 1580s, most of them being noted for their loyalty to the English Crown. Maurice in time was to recover much of the property forfeited by his Baltinglass cousins, which remained in the family into the eighteenth century. In matters of religion the family was  deeply divided in sympathy; the judge's granduncle, also named Maurice Eustace, was denounced to the authorities as a Jesuit in 1581, tried for high treason, found guilty and executed. The judge himself, though a Protestant, was exceptionally tolerant in matters of religion, to the point of lobbying for increased civil rights for Catholics.\n\nA later Sir Maurice Eustace, 1st Baronet, first and last of the Eustace baronets of Castle Martin, belonged to the same branch of the family, being a grandson of one of the Chancellor's uncles: he should not be confused with a third Sir Maurice Eustace who was the Lord Chancellor's nephew, nor with the Lord Chancellor's natural son, who was yet another Maurice.\n\nEarly career\nEustace attended the  University of Dublin, and after graduating he became a fellow of the University, and its lecturer in Hebrew. In his will, he left a legacy to maintain a Hebrew lecture at Trinity.  However he had set his heart on a legal career,  and after two years he resigned from the fellowship and entered Lincoln's Inn. He was also determined on a career in politics,  and he had made a  number  of useful political contacts through his father, who knew the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison,  and other senior officials.\n\nHe spent some time in England after he was called to the Bar,  but he was back in Dublin by 1630. He quickly built up an extremely lucrative legal practice; it was said he could \"earn forty gold pieces in a morning\". From quite early in his career he aimed at the office of Prime Serjeant.\n\nHe entered the Irish House of Commons in 1634 as the member for Athy. Unlike some of the \"Old English\", he was a whole-hearted supporter of the powerful and formidable Lord Deputy of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford,  who in return praised Eustace as a man of integrity and ability, and knighted  him.  Their friendship led to a  rift between Eustace and Adam Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus, the Lord Chancellor, who had befriended him and frequently employed his legal services, but who became an implacable opponent of Strafford. Eustace became Prime Serjeant, then the senior Crown legal adviser, a position he had lobbied for over several years. As Serjeant he acted as an extra justice of assize in 1637, at the request of Wentworth, who wished to curb the ambition of the rising barrister Jerome Alexander, who had hoped to gain preferment by acting as an assize judge, but whom Wentworth detested.  In 1640 Maurice was re-elected to the Commons as the member for County Kildare and became Speaker of the House. His formal speech of welcome to Wentworth at the opening of the 1640 Parliament is  a good example of his ornate style of oratory, which was much admired at the time:\n\n\"Welcome, most worthy Lord, to the new birth of this our Parliament; this is the voice of the House of Commons, and I am sure it is the voice of the whole assembly; it is beside Vox Populi abroad, and I am sure it is Vox Dei\".\n\nThe Speaker also received a generous salary, which appears to have amounted to a single payment of \u00a33000. In the 1660s and 1670s Dame Dorothy Ryves, widow and executrix of Sir William Ryves, who had been acting Speaker of the Irish  House of Lords  during the later sessions of the same  Parliament,  petitioned the  Crown repeatedly for payment of the same amount, complaining that her husband had not received his salary of \u00a33000, whereas Eustace had.\n\nUnlike many of Strafford's political allies, he did not suffer politically as a result of Strafford's impeachment and execution in 1641. Although the \"Old English\" gentry had come to detest Strafford as much as the \"New English\" settlers did,  Eustace was one of their own, and, though he had quarrelled with  Lord Loftus, was generally liked and respected. He remained Speaker of the Commons until 1647; at its final meeting the House voiced its thanks for \"the many good services performed by Sir Maurice Eustace their Speaker\", and spoke ominously of the \"inveterate hatred and malice of the detestable rebels\" against him.\n\nCivil War\nSo long as Dublin remained under Royalist control, Eustace prospered, despite his frequent complaints about the invasion of his property, the despoiling of his woods and the theft of his cattle.  There was also  a bitter  private  feud  between  the \nEustace and Meredyth families, in which there were undoubtedly faults on both sides. The  feud no doubt \nexplains  the  bitter animosity between  Eustace  and  Sir  Robert  Meredyth, the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland, which reached its height after the Restoration.\n\nHe recovered the old family manor of Palmerstown,   which had passed,  after the Baltinglass branch of the  Eustace family suffered forfeiture of their estates,  to the Allen family. In 1643, being known as a man who had some sympathy for the plight of Irish Roman Catholics, most of whom he thought would lay down their weapons if promised a pardon, he was sent to negotiate with the Irish Confederacy at Kilkenny. He obtained the reversion to the office of Master of the Rolls in Ireland, and acquired land at Athy and Cong (he was dispossessed of his lands at Cong after the Restoration, much to the amusement of his political opponents). In 1647, however, the Marquis of Ormonde surrendered Dublin to the Parliamentary forces. Eustace was arrested soon afterwards and sent to Chester Castle where he remained for seven years. His confinement cannot have been very strict,  as he formed an extra-marital relationship with a lady (whose name is not known) which produced two children. He and his children's mother, who is said to have been a person of a good family, were still on friendly terms in the 1660s.\n\nOn his release, he returned to Dublin. He was re-arrested, and briefly imprisoned,  on suspicion of corresponding with Charles II,  but was quickly released and allowed to resume practice at the Bar. His loyalty to the Stuart dynasty was never in serious doubt, and it is likely that he was kept under some degree of surveillance. At the same time, he enjoyed the goodwill of Henry Cromwell, who spoke of him as an eminent lawyer  \"to whom I am beholden and owe a kindness\". Precisely what service Eustace had performed for Cromwell is unclear.\n\nRestoration\n\nAt the Restoration, Eustace's unquestioned loyalty to the Crown,  combined with his legal and political experience,  made him on the face of it a man who was ideally suited to high office; in addition, he was personally close to the Duke of Ormonde, who would do anything to help a friend.  Accordingly, he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland and a Lord Justice of Ireland, exercising the powers of the Lord Lieutenant in his absence, jointly with Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath and Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery. He accepted a peerage but later changed his mind, presumably because he had no legitimate son to inherit it.\n\nIronically the only serious objection to his appointment came from Eustace himself. He was increasingly drawn to country life and had looked forward to his retirement to his beloved country seat Harristown Castle,  which he was rebuilding after the damage it had suffered during the Civil War, and which by the time of his death was considered to be one of the finest houses in Ireland. Also he honestly doubted if his age and ill-health fitted him for high office. He wrote pathetically to the Secretary of State:\n\n\"I... am now grown too old to perform any public service. I desire no such post nor any favour except to remain in his Majesty's good opinion. I hope I shall not now be put beyond my strength with any public employment \".\n\nLord Justice of Ireland \nAs Lord Justice, Eustace was embroiled in the bitter disputes (which led to the passing of the Act of Settlement 1662)  between the mainly Roman Catholic Royalists who had been dispossessed in the Cromwellian Settlement of 1652,  and the Parliamentarian newcomers who had bought their estates. Eustace by birth was a member of the dispossessed class and identified himself entirely with its interests; and though he was himself a Protestant he believed firmly in equal rights for Roman Catholics. This put him at odds with his fellow Lords Justices, Mountrath  (until his death at the end of 1661) and Orrery: they were firm supporters of the Cromwellians, whom Eustace regarded as criminals, and in his view, they were both implacably hostile to the Catholics. In his private correspondence with Ormonde, he denounced his fellow Lords Justices with such venom that Ormonde in reply urged him to show more discretion.  He  suffered a  personal \ndefeat when he failed,  despite  strenuous  efforts,   to prevent his  old enemy  Sir  Robert Meredyth  from  being  reappointed Chancellor of the Exchequer,  though he came very close to success. \n\nEustace did obtain some concessions for the Royalists in the Act of Settlement, but the struggle exhausted him and he was thankful when Ormonde's arrival in Dublin in 1662 allowed him to resign as Lord Justice. Always a shrewd man of business, Eustace was careful to get a private Act of the Irish Parliament passed to confirm his right to his estates, except Cong, which the Court of Claims returned to its original Catholic owners, much to the amusement of his enemies, who gleefully pointed to his constant lectures on the rights of Catholic landowners.\n\nLord Chancellor of Ireland \nEustace's prediction that he would be a failure as Lord Chancellor was by general agreement amply fulfilled:   political struggles, physical illness, frequent bouts of depression and family troubles almost incapacitated him in the last years of his life. He was also discouraged by the failure of his well-meant efforts to ensure religious toleration for Roman Catholics: Ormonde, though he was personally tolerant enough in matters of religion,  would give him no support in this, having settled on a policy of simply turning a blind eye to the practice of the Catholic faith in so far as this was possible. He refused to let Eustace permit Catholic barristers to plead in his Court or to be appointed to Commissions for the Peace, and gave him the sensible advice that he should not worry about what he could not change.\n\nIn 1663 Eustace appears to have had a nervous breakdown, which left him completely unable to perform his duties for a time. By this time,   a number of complaints about Eustace's unfitness for office had reached the English Lord Chancellor, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, who had not been consulted about Eustace's appointment, since Ormonde had been given full powers to appoint the Irish judges. Clarendon,  who had an extremely low opinion of Eustace's abilities,  wrote to Ormonde that he should either do the honourable thing by resigning or be dismissed. Ormonde was always loyal, perhaps to a fault, to his old friends:  Elrington Ball remarks that those whom he had ever loved, he would love to the end. He did not defend Eustace's conduct as a judge, but pointed to his long record of loyalty to the English Crown and suggested that dismissal would be a poor reward for it. In the event, it proved very difficult to find a suitable replacement as Chancellor and the question of Eustace's dismissal was still pending when he died. His death did not resolve the problem of finding a suitable replacement, and for the last time it was decided to appoint a senior cleric, Michael Boyle, Archbishop of Armagh, as Lord Chancellor. Ironically Boyle, a non-lawyer, was generally considered to be a better Chancellor than Eustace, as his conscientious devotion to duty made up for his lack of legal training.\n\nHeirs\nEustace had always been an acute man of business,  and despite his professional troubles he continued to prosper financially, recovering most of the Eustace estates forfeited by the Baltinglass branch of the family (some of which he returned to dispossessed Catholic cousins),   and amassing a fortune which was reckoned to be between sixty and eighty thousand pounds (making him a multi-millionaire by modern standards). He owned lands in several counties and did much to improve the town of Baltinglass. He regained the family's Palmerstown estate, and bought lands at Chapelizod, which later became part of Phoenix Park.\n\nHow to dispose of his fortune was a problem which greatly pre-occupied him during his last years. His marriage in 1633 to Cicely (or Charity) Dixon (1606\u20131678), daughter of Sir Robert Dixon, Lord Mayor of Dublin, was childless. During his years in Chester he had entered a relationship which produced a son (also called Maurice) and a daughter Mary, both of whom he was anxious to provide for, especially as he was still on friendly terms with their mother,  who pressed her son's claim to the inheritance.  Ball, who does not name her, suggests that she was a person of some social standing. Eustace had evidently made a promise to her to leave his lands to their son, which conflicted with his public promise to leave them to his nephew Maurice, the son of his brother William by  Anne Netterville, daughter of Sir Robert Netterville of County Meath.  He consulted the renowned preacher Jeremy Taylor, Bishop of Down and Connor,  on the ethical question as to whether his pledge to his children's mother was binding: Taylor advised that it was not, but Eustace still wavered. How to balance the claims of his son and his two nephews, Maurice and John  (another son of William),  became almost an obsession with him, to the point where even his loyal friend Ormonde was forced to rebuke him for neglecting official business in favour of his private concerns. His last will divided the property between his nephews, a decision which led to ill-feeling and much further litigation (which was probably \nconnected with a determined effort by one Captain Anglesey to seize possession of Eustace's townhouse).\n\nThe younger Sir Maurice ultimately gained possession of both Harristown and the  Dublin townhouse on Eustace Street.  He sat in the House of Commons for many years but was expelled for non-attendance in 1695.  He returned to Ireland from exile, his brother John having died abroad,  in 1697,  and he, in turn, died in 1703 without surviving male issue. He had married firstly Anne Colville and secondly Clotilda Parsons. His estate was divided between his three surviving daughters, of whom the best-known is the younger Clotilda (1700\u20131792), \"a clever and excellent woman\",  who married the poet Thomas Tickell, and was the grandmother of the playwright Richard Tickell. Her half-sister Penelope married firstly Robert Echlin (1674-1706)MP,  eldest son of Sir Henry Echlin,  and secondly Edward Stratford, while her half-sister Anne (died 1713) married the Irish MP Benjamin Chetwood, by whom she had several children.\n\nTitle\n\nElrington Ball states that Eustace was offered a peerage shortly after the Restoration. With that habit of dithering which was so marked a feature of his character in his last years, he at first accepted the title Baron Portlester  (commemorating a renowned fifteenth-century member of the Eustace family),  and then changed his mind,  on the ground that there was little point in creating a title which would not pass to either his  natural son or his nephews.\n\nDeath and memorials\nIn 1665 Eustace, though by then he was over seventy years old, appeared to have recovered his physical and mental health. At his niece  Mary's wedding to Richard Dixon (who was apparently a  relative of Maurice's wife)  in the summer,  he was \"as brisk as a bee\". He gave the couple his estate at Calverstown, County Kildare as a wedding gift; it later passed by inheritance to the Borrowes family.  Shortly afterwards however he had a stroke and died. He was buried in a private ceremony the morning after his death at Castlemartin and the Government commemorated his services to the Crown with an official memorial in St. Patrick's Cathedral three weeks later, with a wax effigy taking the place of his corpse. It was rumoured that the official service was designed to counter a story that the private ceremony had been a Catholic one. His widow survived until 1678.\n\nHis name was given to Eustace Street in Dublin city centre, where his townhouse, Damask, stood. No trace of Damask survives today, but it is known to have been one of the largest houses in Dublin, and both the house and the gardens were much admired by Jonathan Swift. Eustace's death led to a dispute in which his heirs had to fight off a determined effort by one \"Captain Anglesey\",  of whom little else is known, to take possession of Damask by force.\n\nReferences\n\n1665 deaths\n1590s births\nPoliticians from County Kildare\nMembers of the Privy Council of Ireland\nPeople of the Irish Confederate Wars\nIrish MPs 1634\u20131635\nIrish MPs 1639\u20131649\nSpeakers of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801)\nFellows of Trinity College Dublin\nMembers of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Kildare constituencies\nSerjeants-at-law (Ireland)", "machine_text": " Maurice Eustace (Lord Chancellor)\n\nMaurice Eustace was a prominent figure in British politics and law during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. He served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1500 to 1506, and again from 1509 to 1515.\n\nEustace was born around 1450, the son of a minor noble family in Cambridgeshire. He studied law at Cambridge University and was admitted to the bar in 1476. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled lawyer and was appointed as a serjeant-at-law in 1483.\n\nEustace's rise to political prominence began in 1485, when he was appointed as a member of the King's Council by King Henry VII. He served in this role for several years, becoming a trusted advisor to the king and playing a key role in the administration of justice.\n\nIn 1500, Eustace was appointed as Lord Chancellor, the highest legal position in the land. He served in this role for six years, during which time he oversaw a number of significant legal reforms. He was particularly known for his efforts to reduce the power of the ecclesiastical courts and to strengthen the authority of the common law courts.\n\nEustace was also a strong supporter of the royal prerogative, and he played a key role in defending the king's rights against the claims of the nobility and the Church. He was a skilled diplomat and negotiator, and he was involved in a number of important international negotiations during his time as Lord Chancellor.\n\nDespite his many accomplishments, Eustace's time as Lord Chancellor was not without controversy. He was criticized for his efforts to restrict the power of the ecclesiastical courts, and he faced opposition from the Church hierarchy. He also faced criticism for his close ties to the king and his perceived lack of independence.\n\nEustace was removed from the position of Lord Chancellor in 1506, but he returned to the position in 1509 and served for a further six years. During this time, he continued to promote the interests of the crown and to work towards a more centralized and efficient legal system.\n\nEustace died in 1515, shortly after his second term as Lord Chancellor came to an end. He was widely respected for his legal expertise and his service to the crown, and he is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of the English legal system.\n\nOverall, Maurice Eustace played a significant role in the development of the English legal system during the early 16th century. His efforts to strengthen the authority of the common law courts and to promote the interests of the crown helped to shape the course of English legal history. His legacy continues to be felt today, and his contribution to the development of the English legal system is still widely recognized and respected.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 30728425}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Diogo Dalot\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jos\u00e9 Diogo Dalot Teixeira (; born 18 March 1999), known as Diogo Dalot, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a right-back for  club Manchester United and the Portugal national team.\n\nDalot is a product of the Porto youth system and made his professional debut for the club's  B team in January 2017. He made his first-team debut in a Ta\u00e7a de Portugal game in October 2017. After making eight appearances for Porto, he joined Manchester United in June 2018 for a reported fee of \u20ac22\u00a0million (\u00a319\u00a0million). From October 2020 to June 2021, Dalot was loaned to Italian Serie A club Milan.\n\nDalot was a youth international and represented Portugal from under-15 to under-21 level. He was a member of the under-17 squad that won the 2016 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. He made his senior international debut for Portugal at UEFA Euro 2020.\n\nClub career\n\nPorto\nBorn in Braga, Dalot joined Porto's youth system in 2008, aged nine. On 28 January 2017, he made his senior debut with the B team, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2\u20131 home loss against Leix\u00f5es for the LigaPro championship.\n\nDalot first appeared with the first-team in a competitive game on 13 October 2017, starting in a 6\u20130 away win over Lusitano de \u00c9vora for the season's Ta\u00e7a de Portugal. He first played in the Primeira Liga on 18 February 2018, coming on as a 75th-minute substitute in a 5\u20130 home routing of Rio Ave.\n\nManchester United\nDalot signed for Premier League club Manchester United on 6 June 2018 on a five-year contract for a fee of \u00a319\u00a0million. Upon his arrival in Manchester, coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho said that, considering his young age, he was one of the best right-backs around. He made his debut on 19 September 2018 in an away UEFA Champions League group stage match against Swiss side Young Boys, but was unable to have continuity in the team due to an injury sustained in the previous season. His debut in the Premier League happened on December 1 against Southampton in a 2\u20132 draw On 26 January 2020. Despite Mourinho's sacking and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer being appointed as the new manager, Dalot remained a valuable option: at the end of the season, he had had 23 appearances, 16 of which in the Premier League. During that season, he had a memorable match in Paris, in the Champions League quarter-finals 2 nd leg against PSG, where Manchester United completed a remarkable comeback thanks to a late penalty, won after a shot by Dalot. He scored the second goal in a 6\u20130 FA Cup win against Tranmere Rovers; it was his first goal for United.\n\nDuring his first seasons for the club, Dalot struggled with various injuries and following the arrival of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, his performances were severely limited under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nLoan to AC Milan\nFollowing sporadic use by Manchester United, Dalot was loaned to Italian Serie A side AC Milan for the 2020\u201321 season. He made his debut for Milan on 22 October, starting in a 3\u20131 win against Celtic in a UEFA Europa League group stage match. Seven days later, Dalot scored his first goal for Milan and provided an assist for compatriot Rafael Le\u00e3o in a 3\u20130 home group stage victory in the UEFA Europa League against Sparta Prague. He made his Serie A debut on 1 November, replacing Davide Calabria in the 71st-minute of a 2\u20131 away win against Udinese. He made his first start in the league in a 2\u20132 away draw against Genoa. On 7 March 2021, Dalot score his first Serie A goa in a 2\u20130 away in at Hellas Verona. \n\nDuring the season, Dalot's versatility enabled him to play either as a right back and left back. This made him an integral part of Stefano Pioli's team, helping Milan secure second place in the 2020\u201321 Serie A and qualification for the 2021\u201322 UEFA Champions League after an eight-year absence. During his spell as a Rossonero, he was able to play regularly, making 33 appearances, scoring two goals and provinding three assists. As often said by Dalot himself, in Italy he was able to improve defensively, without losing his ability to attack.\n\nReturn to Manchester United\n\nDuring the summer of 2021, Manchester United were interested in signing another right-back. Meanwhile, Milan, who were impressed with Dalot during his loan move with the club, began negotiations with Manchester United to sign him on permanent basis. After returning to Manchester United, he impressed coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with his performances during pre-season. Borussia Dortmund were also interested in signing him on a loan deal, but he decided to remain at United to compete with Aaron Wan-Bissaka for a starting position. On 22 September, Dalot was given his first start of the season, featuring in a 1\u20130 home loss to West Ham United in the third round of the EFL Cup. Since then, he has had limited opportunities with two starts and three substitute appearances. He played against Villarreal in a Champions League group stage match after Wan-Bissaka was suspended for two games. \n\nOn 2 December, Dalot was given his first start in the league under interim manager Michael Carrick, putting an impressive performance and creating the second goal in a 3\u20132 home win over United's rivals Arsenal at Old Trafford. Following the arrival of interim manager Ralf Rangnick, Dalot cemented his place as starter for the club, following his solid performances in the club's next two matches against Crystal Palace and Norwich City.\n\nInternational career\n\nYouth\nDalot helped Portugal win the 2016 UEFA European Under-17 Championship, scoring twice in five games in Azerbaijan including once in the final against Spain. The same year, he helped the under-19 team reach the quarter-finals of the same competition.\n\nWith the under-19s, Dalot participated in the 2017 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, helping finishing as runner-up, after losing in the final to England. For his performances throughout the competition, he was named in the \"Team of the Tournament\".

Dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 20,000 to 15,000 years ago, these figurines are considered to be some of the earliest and most significant examples of prehistoric art in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe discovery of the Venus figurines of Gagarino was made in the late 19th century, when a group of archaeologists unearthed several small statuettes made of bone and ivory. The figurines were found in the remains of a ancient campfire, along with other artifacts such as stone tools and animal bones.\n\nThe Gagarino Venus figurines are similar in style and shape to the more famous Venus of Willendorf, discovered in Austria in 1908. Both are small, portable statuettes depicting a woman with exaggerated sexual features, such as large breasts, hips, and buttocks. The Gagarino figurines, however, are smaller and more detailed, with intricate carvings depicting clothing, jewelry, and hairstyles.\n\nThe significance of the Venus figurines of Gagarino lies in their representation of the female form and their possible use in prehistoric rituals. It is believed that these figurines were used in fertility rituals, with the exaggerated sexual features symbolizing the fertility and reproduction of the female figure. The Gagarino Venus figurines are also thought to have been used in religious ceremonies, with the carvings on the statuettes depicting specific clans or tribes.\n\nThe discovery of the Gagarino Venus figurines has contributed significantly to our understanding of prehistoric cultures in Eastern Europe. The figurines provide evidence of the early development of art and symbolism, and offer a glimpse into the lives and beliefs of ancient communities.\n\nIn conclusion, the Venus figurines of Gagarino are a fascinating example of prehistoric art and culture. Their discovery has shed light on the lives and beliefs of ancient communities in Eastern Europe, and their significance continues to be studied and appreciated by archaeologists and art historians today.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 54352107}

College coaches play a vital role in shaping the lives of young athletes and helping them to achieve their full potential.\n\nThe primary responsibility of a college coach is to develop and implement a training program that will enable their team to perform at its best. This includes designing drills, practices, and conditioning programs that will improve the skills and physical fitness of the athletes. College coaches also work closely with their players to identify areas of strength and weakness, and to develop strategies for improvement.\n\nIn addition to their coaching duties, college coaches are also responsible for recruiting new players to join their team. This involves identifying talented high school athletes and persuading them to attend the college and join the team. College coaches may also be involved in fundraising and promoting their team within the community.\n\nCollege coaches work in a variety of sports, including football, basketball, soccer, and many others. They may work at small colleges or large universities, and may coach teams at the Division I, Division II, or Division III level.\n\nThe qualifications required to become a college coach vary depending on the sport and the level of the team. In general, college coaches must have a bachelor's degree and significant experience playing or coaching their sport. Many college coaches have advanced degrees, such as a master's or doctoral degree, and may have specialized certifications in areas such as strength and conditioning or sports psychology.\n\nThe salary for a college coach can vary widely depending on the level of the team and the sport. Division I coaches at major universities may earn hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, while coaches at smaller colleges may earn significantly less.\n\nThe role of a college coach is not only to develop athletes, but also to help them become well-rounded individuals.

College coaches are often seen as mentors and role models by their players, and they play a significant role in shaping the lives of young athletes.\n\nIn recent years, college coaching has become increasingly competitive, with many coaches feeling pressure to win at all costs. This has led to controversies such as recruiting violations and player abuse, which have tarnished the reputation of college athletics. However, despite these challenges, the role of the college coach remains an important and rewarding one, with many coaches dedicated to helping their players achieve success both on and off the field.\n\nIn conclusion, college coaches play a vital role in the development of young athletes, and are responsible for guiding and motivating their teams to achieve success. They must possess a combination of technical knowledge, leadership skills, and personal qualities that enable them to inspire and support their players.

He married one Elisabeth, traditionally identified with Elisabeth of Chappes, a scion of a fellow crusader family, an identification rejected by Longnon.\n\nHe took the cross with his uncle, Geoffrey of Villehardouin, the future chronicler of the Fourth Crusade, at a tournament of \u00c9cry-sur-Aisne in late November 1199. Geoffrey were among the crusaders who went directly to Syria. Thus he was not present at the occupation of Constantinople by the crusaders on 13 April 1204.\n\nBut hearing of the capture of the great city on the Bosporus, he decided to sail west in the summer of 1204. But the weather became bad, and adverse winds drove him westward. He landed at Modon (now Methoni, Greece) in the southern Peloponnese where he spent the winter of 1204\u20131205.\n\nConquest of the Peloponnese \n\nAt Modon, Geoffrey entered into an alliance with a Greek archon (nobleman) from Messenia to conquer as much of the western Peloponnese as they could. Almost immediately afterward, however, the Greek died, and his son broke off the alliance. It was at this point that Geoffrey learned of the appearance of King Boniface I of Thessalonica (1204\u20131207) with his army before Nauplia (now Nafplion, Greece). He determined to seek aid and rode up early in 1205 to join the king. He was well received by Boniface I who would have retained Geoffrey in his service. But in the camp at Nauplia, Geoffrey found his good friend William of Champlitte and offered to the latter to share the conquest of the Peloponnese. His friend accepted the offer and the two also received royal permission for their expedition.\n\nThey set out with 100 knights and 400 mounted men-at-arms upon their campaign in the spring of 1205. They took Patras and Pondikos by assault, and Andravida opened its gates. The people of the countryside came to make their submission and were confirmed in their property and local customs. Only in Arcadia (now Kyparissia) were the crusaders resisted. This opposition was led by landlords from Arcadia and Laconia, particularly the Chamaretos family, allied to the Slavic Melingoi tribe. The resistance was soon joined by a certain Michael, identified by many scholars with Michael I Komnenos Doukas (1204\u20131215) who was then creating his own principality in Epiros. Michael advanced into the Peloponnese with 5,000 men, but the little crusader army defeated him at Kountouras in northeast Messenia. Then the crusaders completed the conquest of the region and advanced into the interior of the country, occupying the entire peninsula with the exception of Arcadia and Laconia.\n\nWilliam of Champlitte thus became master of the Peloponnese with the title prince of Achaea (1205\u20131209) under the suzerainty of the king of Thessalonica. Geoffrey received Kalamata and Messenia as a fief from the new prince. However, the Republic of Venice proceeded to make good her claims that the leaders of the Fourth Crusade had guaranteed it by the partition treaty of 1204 to the important way stations along the sea route to Constantinople. Thus the Venetians armed a fleet which took Modon and Coron (Koroni) in 1206, but William of Champlitte compensated Geoffrey by assigning Arcadia to him.\n\nReign in Achaea \n\nIn 1208 William I of Achaea departed for France in order to claim an inheritance his brother had left to him. William I appointed Geoffrey to administer the principality as bailiff until the prince\u2019s nephew, Hugh should arrive. However, both the first prince of Achaea and his nephew died very shortly.\n\nIn May 1209, Geoffrey went to the Parliament of Ravennika that the Latin Emperor Henry I (1206\u20131216) had convoked at Ravennika to assure the emperor of his loyalty. The emperor confirmed Geoffrey as prince of Achaea and made him immediate imperial vassal. Moreover, Henry I also appointed Geoffrey seneschal of the Latin Empire.\n\nThe Chronicle of the Morea narrates that Geoffrey only became prince of Achaea some time later, because the late William I\u2019s nephew, Robert had a year and a day to travel to the Peloponnese and claim his inheritance. According to the story, all sorts of ruses were used to cause delays in Robert\u2019s trip east, and when he finally arrived in the Peloponnese Geoffrey kept moving from place to place with the leading knights until the time had elapsed. Geoffrey then held an assembly that declared that the heir had forfeited his rights and elected Geoffrey hereditary prince of Achaea.\n\nNevertheless, already in June 1209 Geoffrey made a pact with the Venetians on the island of Sapientza, whereby he acknowledged himself to be the vassal of the Republic of Venice for all the lands extending from Corinth to the roadstead of Navarino (now Pylos, Greece). Geoffrey I also gave Venice the right to free trade throughout his principality.\n\nAfterward Geoffrey I devoted himself to enlarging his possessions. With the aid of Otto I, the lord of Athens (1204\u20131225), he seized, in 1209 or 1210, the fortress of Acrocorinth where first Leo Sgouros, and then Theodore Komnenos Doukas, brother of Michael I of Epirus had resisted the attacks of the crusaders. In the months that followed, Nauplia was also taken, and early in 1212 the stronghold of Argos, where Theodore Komnenos Doukas had stored the treasure of the Church of Corinth, likewise fell into the hands of Geoffrey I and Otto I. When Albertino and Rolandino of Canossa, the lords of Thebes had left their town, the lordship of Thebes was divided equally between Geoffrey I and the lord of Athens.\n\nGeoffrey I sent to France, mainly to Champagne, for young knights to occupy the newly conquered lands and the fiefs of those who had returned to the west. Under Geoffrey I the assignment of fiefs and the obligations which went with them were reviewed before the barons assembled in a great parliament at Andravida. Thus a dozen or so great baronies came into being in the principality, and those who received the titles to them made up with their many vassals the High Court of Achaea.\n\nAt the time of the conquest much ecclesiastical property had been secularized and, despite the demands of the clergy, this had not been returned to the churches. The Chronicle of the Morea reports that when the churches refused to provide their fair share of military aid, Geoffrey I seized their property and devoted the income from it to the construction of the powerful castle of Clermont. Furthermore, Geoffrey I was also accused of treating the Greek priests as serfs because their numbers had considerably increased, since the Greek prelates showed no hesitation in conferring orders on peasants to permit them to escape the burdens of serfdom. These events resulted in a prolonged conflict with the church.\n\nFirst the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, Gervasius promulgated a decree of excommunication against Geoffrey I and laid an interdict upon Achaea. Upon the request of Geoffrey I, however, on 11 February 1217 Pope Honorius III (1216\u20131227) declared that the patriarch was to relax the sentence within a week after the receipt of the papal letter. Then the patriarch sent out a legate who laid a new interdict upon the Principality of Achaea. But his act was again qualified by the pope as usurpation of the power of the Holy See.\n\nNext the papal legate Cardinal Giovanni Colonna who was travelling through the Peloponnese in 1218 excommunicated Geoffrey I because of the prince's contumacious retention of certain abbeys, churches, rural parishes, and ecclesiastical goods. Upon the request of the local high clergy, the pope confirmed Geoffrey I's excommunication on 21 January 1219. The pope even declared Geoffrey I to be an enemy of God \u201cmore inhuman than Pharaoh\u201d.\n\nThe conflict lasted some five years, until 1223 when Geoffrey I decided to negotiate and sent one of his knights to Rome. Finally on September 4, 1223 Pope Honorius III confirmed the accord that had been drawn up between the prince and the church of Achaea. According to the treaty, Geoffrey I restored the church lands, but he kept the treasures and furnishings of the churches in exchange for an annual indemnity and the number of Greek priests enjoying liberty and immunity was also to be limited in proportion to the size of the community.\n\nIn the meantime, Theodore Komnenos Doukas, now ruler of Epirus (1215\u20131224), had attacked the kingdom of Thessalonica and laid siege the kingdom's capital. William I, despite the urgent appeals of the pope, did not appear to have assisted the threatened city that finally surrendered near the end of 1224.\n\nGeoffrey died sometime between 1228 and 1230 at the age of about sixty. He was buried in the Church of St James in Andravida.\n\nFootnotes\n\nSee also \nFourth Crusade\nPrincipality of Achaea\nChronicle of Morea\n\nReferences \n \n Evergates, Theodore (2007).

He was a member of the noble family of Villehardouin and served as a prominent military leader during the crusade.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nGeoffrey was born in the 1150s, the son of Robert de Villehardouin, a knight and lord of the castle of Villehardouin in the Duchy of Normandy. Little is known about his early life, but he is believed to have received a typical education for a noble child, including training in arms and chivalry.\n\nGeoffrey's military career began in the 1170s, when he fought alongside his father in the army of King Louis VII of France. He distinguished himself in several campaigns, including the Battle of Montgisard in 1177, where he helped to defeat the forces of Saladin.\n\nThe Fourth Crusade\n\nIn 1200, Geoffrey joined the Fourth Crusade, which was called by Pope Innocent III to retake the Holy Land from Muslim forces. He was part of the army led by Boniface of Montferrat, who was the leader of the crusade.\n\nGeoffrey played a significant role in the siege of Constantinople, which was the capital of the Byzantine Empire. He was part of the group of knights who breached the city walls and entered the city, leading to its capture by the crusaders.\n\nAfter the capture of Constantinople, Geoffrey was appointed as the governor of the city by Boniface. He served in this role until 1204, when the city was recaptured by the Byzantines.\n\nWritings\n\nGeoffrey is also known for his writings, particularly his book \"The Conquest of Constantinople\", which describes the events of the Fourth Crusade. The book is considered one of the most important sources of information about the crusade and is still studied by historians today.\n\nThe book is written in a clear and concise style and provides a detailed account of the events leading up to and during the crusade. It includes descriptions of battles, sieges, and negotiations between the crusaders and the Byzantines.\n\nGeoffrey's writing is also notable for its objectivity, as he attempts to present a balanced view of the events, rather than a purely partisan account. He also includes details about the culture and customs of the people he encountered during his travels, providing valuable insights into the societies of the time.\n\nLegacy\n\nGeoffrey I of Villehardouin is remembered as a brave and skilled military leader who played a significant role in the Fourth Crusade. His writings provide a valuable record of the events of the crusade and have helped to shape our understanding of this important period in history.\n\nThrough his participation in the crusade and his writings, Geoffrey left a lasting legacy in the fields of military history and medieval studies. He is considered one of the most important figures of the medieval period and continues to be studied and remembered today.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3362090}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Casa de Portugal in S\u00e3o Paulo\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Casa de Portugal is an association of Portuguese immigrants in S\u00e3o Paulo created in 1935.\n\nHistory \nThe Casa de Portugal was founded on 13 July 1935 with the aim of representing all Portuguese immigrants and their descendants in S\u00e3o Paulo. There were many Portuguese associations in the city, representing immigrants from specific regions of Portugal, and the original idea of the founders was to bring these organizations under one roof. The foundation of the Casa de Portugal saw representatives of Uni\u00e3o Transmontana, Casa do Minho, Uni\u00e3o Portuguesa, Centro Beir\u00e3o and Centro do Douro. Other organizations were subsequently invited, but preferred to maintain their regional character and refused. The first president was the philologist Francisco da Luz Rebelo Gon\u00e7alves, a professor at the newly founded University of S\u00e3o Paulo, but he remained in office for only 10 months and was succeeded for the interim by Aur\u00e9lio Martins Arrobas and in 1936 by Fernando Ribeiro Bacellar.\n\nInitially the Casa de Portugal worked at the headquarters of the Casa do Minho and then in rented properties. Through donations from members and bank loans land and buildings were purchased on the Avenida da Liberdade, in the city center in 1943. The inauguration of the headquarters took place on December 27, 1955.\n\nFeatures \nThe headquarters of the Casa de Portugal is a neocolonial building of five floors designed by Portuguese architect Ricardo Severo. The lobby is decorated with paintings depicting Afonso I, the first king of Portugal, and Manuel da Nobrega, a Portuguese Jesuit priest very influential in the early History of Brazil, and who participated in the founding of several cities, such as Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, and many Jesuit Colleges and seminaries. The building also has meeting rooms, a restaurant, theater, gallery exhibition and a ballroom with a capacity for 1,000 people.\n\nThe Casa de Portugal also serves as headquarters for the Council of the Luso-Brazilian Community of S\u00e3o Paulo, the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and the Ombudsman of the Portuguese Community. It was also headquarters for the Consulate of Portugal in S\u00e3o Paulo and the Cam\u00f5es Institute, but these institutions have moved to a building in the Jardim Am\u00e9rica area in 2004.\n\nLibrary \nThe creation of a library for the Casa de Portugal had been planned since its foundation, when the partners began to donate books to the collection. In 1957 the library was opened, and in 1991 it was extended with an auditorium and reading room. Currently it has 12,000 volumes, of which almost half are dedicated to history and Luso-Brazilian literature.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n Facebook page of Casa de Portugal\n\nPortuguese emigrants to Brazil\nPortuguese diaspora\nOrganisations based in S\u00e3o Paulo\n1935 establishments in Brazil", "machine_text": " Casa de Portugal in S\u00e3o Paulo is a cultural and social center that aims to promote the Portuguese culture and heritage in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

Born on March 12, 1935, in Madrid, Spain, Redondo studied at the San Fernando Academy of Fine Arts in Madrid and began his artistic career in the 1950s.\n\nRedondo's early works were heavily influenced by the Impressionist and Expressionist movements, with bold brushstrokes and vivid colors that seemed to burst off the canvas. He quickly gained recognition for his unique style and was featured in numerous exhibitions throughout Spain and Europe.\n\nIn the 1960s, Redondo's art took a dramatic turn as he became fascinated with the human form and the emotions that it could convey. He began to create a series of paintings that depicted the human figure in various states of being, from joy and love to sorrow and despair. These works were characterized by their intense emotional power and their ability to evoke strong feelings in the viewer.\n\nOne of Redondo's most famous works from this period is \"The Embrace,\" a painting that depicts two figures locked in a passionate embrace. The colors are bold and vibrant, with swirling brushstrokes that seem to convey the intensity of the couple's emotions. The painting is now considered a masterpiece of Spanish art and is housed in the Museum of Contemporary Art in Madrid.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Redondo continued to experiment with his style, incorporating elements of Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism into his work. He also became known for his large-scale murals, which he created for public spaces throughout Spain and Europe. These works were often inspired by the natural world and featured sweeping landscapes and vibrant floral patterns.\n\nRedondo was also an accomplished sculptor and created a number of large-scale sculptures that were installed in public spaces throughout Spain. His most famous sculpture, \"The Tree of Life,\" is a massive work that depicts a tree with intertwining branches and figures that seem to come to life before the viewer's eyes. The sculpture is now considered a symbol of Madrid and is featured prominently in the city's Plaza de Cibeles.\n\nThroughout his career, Redondo was recognized with numerous awards and accolades for his contributions to the art world. He was awarded the Gold Medal for Fine Arts by the Spanish government in 1985, and he was also named a Member of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in 1993.\n\nRedondo continued to create art until his death on February 27, 2014, leaving behind a legacy as one of Spain's most important and influential artists of the 20th century. His works continue to be exhibited and admired throughout the world, and his unique style and emotive power continue to inspire artists and art lovers alike.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 57354340}

As a result of injuries sustained at the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, he was paralysed. As of 2007 he could only move his head, torso, and an arm.\n\nCareer \nBrito played as a winger, and spent his career playing for Biscarrosse Olympique in the F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 3 division of French rugby. An electrician by trade, he was noticeable on the field for his long dreadlocks as well as his brave play. Brito was called into the Ivorian national team squad for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Brito came on as a substitute in the opening game against Scotland which the Ivory Coast lost by 89 points to nil, a result which led many to question the inclusion of \"minor\" teams in the tournament. He played again in the second game for Les Elephants, who put in a vastly improved performance against France, despite losing 54\u201318.\n\nInjury \nBrito started Ivory Coast's third match against Tonga on 3 June. He caught a high ball that had been kicked up the field, and set off on a counter-attack. He was tackled by Inoke Afeaki, the Tonga flanker, before a ruck formed over him. The ruck collapsed and several players fell on top of Brito, leaving him prone and motionless on the ground. Brito was taken to the intensive care unit of the Unitas Hospital in Pretoria with broken vertebrae.  Operations were carried out to stabilize the fourth and fifth vertebrae, but Brito was left paralysed below the neck.\t\n\nAfter the accident, Brito was given treatment and compensation, which was funded by all sides competing at the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Nevertheless, in 2007, it was reported that Brito was still largely unable to move, being bedridden most of the time, with only some limited movement in his chest and arms. He and his wife have separated, whilst he has little contact with his sons, and he now lives with his parents in Bordeaux. There has been some criticism of how his case was handled, after the initial support: Damian Hopley, Head of the Professional Rugby Players' Association, said in 2003, \"We became involved in money-raising events for Max ... but there was very little support for him from Rugby World Cup.\"  \n\nIn his 2007 interview, Brito was portrayed as living an unhappy life. He was quoted as saying: \"It is now 12 years since I have been in this state. I have come to the end of my tether... If one day I fall seriously ill, and if I have the strength and courage to take my own life, then I will do it...This bloody handicap - it's my curse. It kills me and I will never accept it. I can't live with it and it's going to be with me for the rest of my life.\"\n\nBut in 2020, in an interview with i, he revealed he had undergone a spiritual transformation that had helped him cope with his disability.\n\n\"I would say there were 13 or 14 years of fog where I didn't know where I was. The accident was very violent. But after that I had a spiritual enlightenment and I understood that it was necessary to accept my handicap. And from that moment on, all the doors were open.\"\n\nReferences \n\n1971 births\nLiving people\nSportspeople from Abidjan\nPeople with tetraplegia\nIvorian rugby union players\nRugby union wings\nIvorian expatriate rugby union players\nExpatriate rugby union players in France\nIvorian expatriate sportspeople in France", "machine_text": " Max Brito is a French-born Israeli computer scientist and researcher who has made significant contributions to the field of algorithms and theoretical computer science.

On a floating island, Monkey D. Luffy is chased by a genetically-enhanced animal. The monster is overpowered by the other monsters before Luffy defeats the fourth monster. The Straw Hats have been separated into three groups: Sanji with Usopp, Roronoa Zoro with Tony Tony Chopper, and Nico Robin with Franky and Brook. Shiki tells Nami that she has been taken to the island against her will and a brief flashback is shown: several days earlier, the Straw Hats read news of an attack on East Blue. Luffy vows to protect the East Blue before witnessing Shiki's ship overhead. After escaping a storm, Shiki meets Nami and reveals his powers to make any inanimate object he touches float. After learning it was Nami that delivered the warning, Shiki offers to take them there before abducting Nami. The others try to rescue her, but Shiki makes the pirates scatter on the island.\n\nShiki asks Nami to become his navigator but she refuses. His minion  demonstrates an evolved bird called , who can produce electricity, but Shiki rejects it after Dr. Indigo is electrocuted. He reveals that a plant, called IQ, can cause animals to evolve instantly and to increase strength along the way. Nami protects Billy, and the bird is left with her as Shiki and his men leave. Meanwhile, Sanji and Usopp battle various animals while Sanji searches for Robin and Nami. Meanwhile, Zoro and Chopper rescue a young girl, , and are led to her village and are told about the large poisonous plants around the village. However, long term exposure to the plants is poisonous to humans, and the girl's grandmother has become ill by it. Xiao was looking for the cure which is the IQ plant, but Shiki has stolen the IQ plants for his experiments. Sanji and Usopp learn that Shiki also takes all the men and young women to his royal palace, leaving the village with only the very young and old, before meeting up with Zoro and Chopper.\n\nNami flees with the help of Billy, and finds the Thousand Sunny along with Luffy. Robin's group discovers that Shiki is planning to release the animals on the island into East Blue to force the World Government's surrender and that he is planning a demonstration against a village on the floating island to show their power. The two join the others at the village, and they also learn of the plan from the village residents. Shiki confronts and defeats the Straw Hats and offers Nami to rejoin him on the condition that the Cocoyashi Village will be spared. Robin's group arrives and rejoin the rest of the crew. Xiao gives them a tone dial and they replay Nami's farewell message to Luffy, but he angrily leaves before the end.\n\nMeanwhile, Nami attempts to destroy the plants protecting his palace, but gets poisoned herself. Shiki traps her near the plants and heads off to meet the pirate captains gathering. While greeting them, the Straw Hats launch a preemptive strike against Shiki and his henchmen. The group manages to defeat them while Chopper and Usopp are ordered to search for Nami. Nami is found by Billy who helps destroy the plants just as Usopp and Chopper arrive. Chopper soon realizes the only way to save Nami is to find the IQ medicine, but Shiki attempts to stop them. Luffy engages Shiki in a duel. The two find the IQ plant, but find the medicine is being held by Dr. Indigo. Zoro manages to defeat Dr. Indigo and Nami recovers.

The Straw Hats rig the palace with explosives. Shiki refocuses his attention on the Straw Hats, but Luffy uses an electric charge and knocks Shiki to the ground, leaving Luffy victorious. The other Straw Hats escape with the Thousand Sunny, using Shiki's pirate sail as a parachute. Luffy is recovered by Billy while the villagers are shown flying away using the wings on their arms. The Marines capture the retreating pirates, including Shiki. As the Marines witness the islands crash into the sea, now free of Shiki's power, they spot the Thousand Sunny.

The Japanese rock band Mr. Children performed the film's theme song, \"Fanfare\". Oda had personally offered them the opportunity.\n\nPromotion \nAn English-language teaser trailer of 45 seconds length was shown on the Tokyo International Anime Fair in March 2009 and later placed on the official website of the One Piece franchise's anime films, when it was relaunched around July 2009. The website began streaming a 96 seconds long trailer on August 8, 2009.

The first eight pages of the issue are occupied by photographs of models, resembling Luffy, Robin, Nami, Zoro, and Sanji, dressed in sea and pirates themed clothes. Furthermore, the issue contains interviews with Oda and K\u014dsuke Kitajima.\n\nThe promotions surrounding Strong World boosted the sales of the One Piece manga during the week of December 7 through 13, causing all 56 then published volumes to be listed in Oricon's Top 200 chart of weekly Japanese manga sales.\n\n Release \nOn December 12, 2009, Strong World opened on 188 screens throughout Japan. For comparison, Ponyo set the record of screens for a domestic film to 481 in July 2008 and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince premiered in Japan in July 2009 on 844 screens.\n\nThe first 1.5 million moviegoers received the \"0th volume\" of the One Piece manga series, containing a prequel story that depicts events from 20 years into the past of the One Piece world, as well as the materials Oda created for Strong World's production.

The worldwide total box office is about .\n\nReviews \nStrong World received largely positive reviews from critics, praising the film's story and character designs, as well as Oda's involvement in the film. Chris Beveridge of The Fandom post described the film as \"a very streamlined Oda story that would have gone on for twenty or thirty episodes if it was done as a regular arc with the TV series\", adding that the storyline was \"predictable\" but also \"well polished\". Beveridge also praised the film for having a stronger connection to the One Piece TV series than the franchises previous films. Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network awarded the film a 'B' rating, praising the storyline and character design. Silverman commented that \"no one can come up with weird laughs or monsters quite like Oda\", although unfavorably comparing some of the animation to \"stop-motion animation\". Silverman also commented on the English dubbing of the film, saying that Ian Sinclair's debut as Brook \"does a very good job with the loopy skeleton\", although she found Scott McNeil's \"pseudo-Caribbean\" accent as Shiki \"a little off-putting\". Despite being largely unfamiliar with the franchise, Kyle Mills of DVD Talk called FUNimations release \"Highly Recommended\", praising the \"terrific cast of characters\" and \"giant kick ass final fight\". Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu-ray.com also recommended Strong World, describing it as \"loud, frenetic and frequently nonsensical,\" but also \"kind of crazily entertaining at the same time\" Kauffman also added that \"while Strong World won't necessarily be incomprehensible to newcomers\", \"those with a solid grounding in the background of the story and its many characters will reap the most rewards from this particular outing\".\nStrong World also currently has a rating of 7.1 out of 10 collated from both film critics and users on IMDb.\n\nAwards and nominations \nIt won the award for Excellent Animation of the Year at the 34th Japan Academy Prize and is nominated for Animation of the Year.\n\nSee also\n List of One Piece films\n List of One Piece media\n List of 2009 box office number-one films in Japan\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website of Toei Animation \n\n2009 films\nJapanese films\n2009 anime films\nFunimation\nToei Animation films\nStrong World\nFilms scored by Kohei Tanaka", "machine_text": " One Piece Film: Strong World is a 2009 Japanese anime fantasy adventure film directed by Munehisa Sakai and produced by Toei Animation.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Robin Hood, West Yorkshire\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Robin Hood is a village in West Yorkshire, England, within the City of Leeds metropolitan borough, with Wakefield WF3, and Leeds LS26 postcodes. It is situated on the A61 and A654 between Leeds and Wakefield, close to Rothwell and Lofthouse.\n\nIt forms part of the Ardsley and Robin Hood ward of Leeds City Council and the Morley and Outwood parliamentary constituency.\n\nThe centre of Robin Hood is believed to be the Halfway House public house, situated at the main junction of the A61 and A654. The public house gained its name from its location being half-way between Leeds and Wakefield, located exactly 4 miles in either direction on the A61. It used to be known as \"The Old Halfway House\" and a public house or inn has been located on that site for centuries.\n\nHistory\n\nRobin Hood was originally part of nearby Carlton village, the original inhabitants were chiefly miners and quarrymen and as such it was built on its large mining history. Its mines at their peak, employing several hundred underground workers for the firm J&J Charlesworth, but the last mine closed in the 1960s.  There has been considerable residential and commercial development in recent years, and has now grown to a population of around 3,573 according to the 2011 census.\n\nName\nThe name Robin Hood was first applied to a spring or well situated near the old quarries, it is believed the well-trough, had an iron ladle chained to it. The well no longer exists, and is believed to have been covered up with quarry refuse. It is believed that the well still runs underground and feeds the local streams in the area. There was local opinion that the ceremony of well-dressing, and a country dance called Robin Hood might have been performed there.\n\nThe folk hero connection\nThe area has a suspected link with the medieval folk hero Robin Hood, as some of the original legends do mention an \"Outwoods\" (quite possibly the Outwood of Wakefield nearby) and the original legends also mention a \"Stane Lea\" (potentially the nearby village of Stanley). Also, most of the original Robin Hood ballads have him operating in and around Barnsdale forest which is close to Wakefield and surrounding areas.\n\nMining history and Robin Hood Colliery \nMining has been performed at various locations in Robin Hood, dating all the way back to the late 1600s. The most notable mining operation was Robin Hood Colliery, which was located opposite the Halfway House pub, and on land located between the A61 and Thorpe Lower Lane A654. The mine opened in 1854 and was operated by J&J Charlesworth, who owned many large collieries in the area. Most of them named after his daughters, including the Robin Hood Colliery which was known as \"Jane Pit\". The pit closed in the 1960s after being nationalised by the National Coal Board in the early 1900s, it stood derelict on the site until the 1980s and used as a ventilation shaft for other main collieries in the area. It is now occupied by a large housing estate built in the 1990s.\n\nRobin Hood Quarries and Brickworks \nRobin Hood was also home to some large stone quarries and an associated brickworks. The main quarry site was located to the left of Thorpe Lower Lane where it meets Middleton Lane, and it was known as \"Robin Hood Quarries\". This operated from the late 1800s and closed in the 1950s. Associated with the quarry was Armitage Brickworks, their offices and stone yard was located at the back of the Robin Hood Colliery and extended up Thorpe Lower Lane towards the quarries. Most of this old site is now occupied by the M1 Motorway built in the 1960s. Their major Brickworks operation site was located next to the quarries and further along Middleton Lane where it meets Thorpe Lane.\n\nRobin Hood station and railways \nRobin Hood had its own passenger station, located between Leadwell Lane A654 and Matty Lane (now known as Hopefield Walk). It opened in 1904 and only lasted for 6 months, it continued to be used for excursions and coal traffic. Finally closed and further demolished in the 1960s. The station was part of a large network of railway lines that operated in the Robin Hood, Lofthouse and Rothwell areas known as the East and West Yorkshire Union Railway. The line was built mainly for colliery traffic and linked all the major collieries in the area, starting at Lofthouse and joining the Midland Main Line just past Stourton in Leeds. A large embankment carried the railway from the A61 near the Gardeners Arms Pub and through to Leadwell Lane A654 where a bridge crossed over and into the station, the embankment still stands today and is now part of the Rothwell Greenway. One half of the old Leadwell Lane bridge abutment still stands today at the end of the embankment.\n\nThere were numerous branches off this railway located all over the Robin Hood area, including a road crossing on the A61 at what is known as Robin Hood Bridge (where West Beck crosses underneath the road). There was also a further road crossing on Thorpe Lower Lane just before the present M1 underpass, and a large railway junction beyond Robin Hood Station towards Rothwell. It also had branches from Thorpe Lower Lane and up to Castle Pit located off Middleton Lane and the Armitage Brickworks and Robin Hood Quarries.\n\nNot much remains of this line today, apart from a few rails buried just under the surface of Milner Lane and overgrown embankments and cuttings along the route to Rothwell.\n\nTelegraph Repeater Station and RAF Bunker \nThere was a large GPO Telegraph Repeater Station located on the corner of Sharpe Lane where it meets the A61 Wakefield Road. It is believed that this was used to boost the strength of electric telephone signals. It also had an associated underground bunker and shelter known as \"RAF Rothwell\" located just behind the GPO building. It was a large concrete building with blast proof doors and was believed to be associated with RAF Menwith Hill. The GPO Repeater building was demolished around 2007, the concrete bunker still stands today and is now located on a private residence.\n\nFootball club\nRobin Hood Athletic Football Club were crowned champions of the West Yorkshire Football League Division One in 2013\u201314 and have since played in its Premier Division.\n\nThe team play from the Coach Ground located just behind the Coach and Horses pub on the A61.\n\nNotable former residents\nKarl Davey\nMark Davey\nErnie Field\nSidney Parkinson\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nThe ancient parish of Rothwell at GENUKI: Robin Hood was in this parish\nRobin Hood Athletic Football Club:  \n\nPlaces in Leeds\nRothwell, West Yorkshire", "machine_text": " Robin Hood, West Yorkshire\n\nRobin Hood is a legendary outlaw known for his heroic deeds and rebellious spirit.

Being one of the youngest domestic teams, they take part in Liga 4, the fourth tier of Georgian league system.\n\nHistory\nOn 6 March 2020 some media outlets announced that newly formed FC Shturmi Sartichala would replace FC Sarti Sartichala, dissolved in 2018, and represent the town in Regional league. Tornike Chaduneli, the former Torpedo Kutaisi defender and Sarti manager, took charge of the team.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season was suspended until August, when a single-round competition between 14 clubs of Group D East began.\n\nBeing debutants in the Georgian league, the club from the very outset displayed an attacking football which greatly contributed to thrashing some rivals. By mid-season with the seven matches behind Shturmi had won five of them with a large margin and reached an astonishing 31:5 aggregate goal difference.\n\nIn mid-October the team was placed in a two-week COVID quarantine. Straight after the games were resumed, Shturmi set their own record by winning 12\u20130. Until the final game week the club kept beating all other opponents, although so did Dinamo-2 Tbilisi who, apart from the same winning run, had a better goal advantage. The decisive tie was supposed to determine a winner of the league group with promotion to Liga 4.\n\nThe match on 20 December in Sartichala drew a great interest among the cheering locals who, unable to get inside the ground, gathered around it. Shturmi took the lead after ten minutes with Dinamo equalizing five minutes later. Numerous attempts to break the well-defending rivals reached a dramatic end in stoppage time when the hosts were awarded a penalty kick. However, goalkeeper Omar Migineishvili saved it and with final score 1-1 Shturmi were denied a victory.\n\nIn late January 2021 Georgian Football Federation decided to enlarge Liga 4 at the expense of all four second-placed Regionuli Liga clubs from the previous season with Shturmi being among these promoted teams.\n\nThe start in the fourth tier was less impressive.

The weapon was developed in the 1950s and entered service in 1960. It was widely used by the Soviet Union and its allies during the Cold War era.\n\nDesign and Development\n\nThe SFC Shturmi was developed as a response to the increasing threat of air power during the early years of the Cold War. The Soviet Union recognized the need for a mobile air defense system that could accompany ground forces and provide them with protection against enemy aircraft. The design of the Shturmi was based on the chassis of the SU-100 tank destroyer, which was modified to accommodate the anti-aircraft gun and its associated equipment.\n\nThe Shturmi was armed with a 57mm autocannon, which was capable of firing up to 120 rounds per minute. The gun was mounted on a traversable turret, which allowed it to engage targets from any direction. The weapon had a maximum altitude of 4,000 meters and a range of up to 8,000 meters. It was also equipped with a sophisticated fire control system that included a radar, a laser rangefinder, and a computerized firing system.\n\nThe Shturmi was designed to operate in a variety of environments, including extreme temperatures and rough terrain. It was powered by a diesel engine, which gave it a maximum speed of 60 km/h on roads. The vehicle had a crew of four, including a commander, a gunner, a radar operator, and a driver.\n\nOperational History\n\nThe SFC Shturmi was first deployed in 1960 and quickly became a mainstay of Soviet air defense capabilities. It was widely used during the Vietnam War, where it proved effective in engaging low-flying enemy aircraft. The weapon was also used in various other conflicts, including the Middle East Wars and the Soviet-Afghan War.\n\nThe Shturmi was also exported to several countries, including Egypt, Syria, and North Korea. It remained in service with the Soviet Union and its successor states until the early 1990s, when it was gradually replaced by more modern air defense systems.\n\nVariants\n\nSeveral variants of the SFC Shturmi were developed over the years, including:\n\n* The Shturmi-1: This was the initial production model, which entered service in 1960. It had a simple fire control system and a limited range of engagement.\n* The Shturmi-2: This variant was introduced in the late 1960s and featured an upgraded fire control system and improved radar. It had a longer range of engagement and was more effective against high-altitude targets.\n* The Shturmi-3: This variant was introduced in the 1970s and featured a more advanced radar system and improved fire control system. It had a longer range of engagement and was capable of engaging multiple targets simultaneously.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe SFC Shturmi was a highly effective air defense weapon that played a significant role in the Soviet Union's military strategy during the Cold War era. Its ability to engage targets from any direction and its high rate of fire made it a formidable weapon against enemy aircraft. The weapon's mobility and versatility also made it an important asset for ground forces, allowing them to provide their own air defense capabilities on the battlefield. The Shturmi remains an important part of military history, serving as a reminder of the Soviet Union's technological prowess and military might.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 66655236}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Office de Radiodiffusion-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision du Mali\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Office of Radio and Television of Mali (Office de radiodiffusion et de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision du Mali, ORTM) is the national broadcaster of the West African state of Mali.\n\nHistory\nMalian broadcasting began in 1957 as a one kilowatt radio station called Radio Soudan in Bamako, then administrative center of the French colony of French Soudan. After independence in 1960, Radio Nationale du Mali (Radio-Mali) began broadcasting from la maison de la Radio in the Bozola neighbourhood of Bamako.  Technical abilities were bolstered with Czech transmitters ranging from 18 to 30 kilowatts in 1962.\n\nIn 1970, the Chinese government constructed four 50\u00a0kW radio transmitters about 7\u00a0km from Bamako, towards Kati, enabling Radio Mali to reach much of West Africa. In 22 September 1983, a Libyan financed television broadcast centre was opened in Bamako, enabling RTM to broadcast one channel of colour television. French and German grant programmes between 1984 and 1990 enabled news and reporting to expand, with regional stations opening in S\u00e9gou (1986), Koulikoro (1989), Sikasso (1990) and Mopti (1993). In 1992, a second national broadcast radio network (Chiffre II) was added.\n\nOn 5 October 1992, the Malian government split off the RTM  according to \"Law 92-021\", from direct government control, becoming a publicly financed, independently run entity (an \"\u00c9tablissement Public \u00e0 Caract\u00e8re Administratif (EPA)\"). This was part of the national liberalisation process, moving the nation to the \"Third Malian Republic\". Private broadcasters were legalised, and RTM was reorganised as the ORTM on 1 January 1993.\n\nORTM was seized by National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State (CNRDR) forces on 21 March 2012 as part of the 2012 Malian coup d'\u00e9tat. A thousand-person protest was held on 26 March, chanting \"Down with Sanogo\" and \"Liberate the ORTM\".\n\nCurrent output\nIn 2002, ORTM had 35 local radio and/or television broadcast points or repeaters, with TV/radio broadcast points in all eight Regions of Mali.  From its headquarters in Bamako, ORTM produces two radio networks (RTM and Chiffre II), a national television network (RTM), and directs the work of a number of regional RTM radio stations.\n\nConsidered one of the freest news markets in Africa, although government office holders threaten (and sometimes resort to) prosecution of broadcasters under Mali's strict anti-libel laws.  In 2001, the head of OTRM was threatened with jail after the government attempted to prosecute RTM for an interview in which the mayor of Bamako accused the Malian judiciary of corruption.  Since 1992, broadcasting is no longer a state monopoly.  There are two large private multi-channel television providers, and numerous private radio stations.  Mali is also considered a world leader in community radio development, with ORTM helping to set up the Union des Radios et Televisions Libres (URTEL) , a network of over a hundred independently locally operated stations.  OTRM also partners with other government and international organisations in education and development programs throughout Mali.\n\nProgramming\nRTM Radio and television broadcast news and information programming, light entertainment (both foreign and domestic), music and sport.  Most national broadcasts are in French, with several hours of Bambara language programming, as well as regional broadcasting in other languages. Emission Hebdomadaire d'Information, the weekly ORTM news magazine, has been broadcasting each Sunday at noon since 1998, and is anchored by Manga Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Youssouf Tour\u00e9.  A daily news program is broadcast twice daily.  Chiffre II radio network is simulcast on the OTRM website, while television broadcasts are carried on regional satellite.

After Mali gained independence in 1960, the station was renamed \"Radio Mali\" and became the national radio broadcaster of the country. In the 1970s, Radio Mali expanded its coverage to include regional stations in major cities across the country.\n\nIn 1983, the Malian government established a national television service called \"T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Mali\" (TVM). Like Radio Mali, TVM was a state-owned broadcaster that operated under the umbrella of the Ministry of Communication.\n\nIn 2002, the Malian government merged Radio Mali and TVM to form the Office de Radiodiffusion-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision du Mali (ORTM). The merger created a single national public service broadcaster responsible for both radio and television broadcasting in Mali.\n\nServices\n\nORTM operates two national television channels, TVM1 and TVM2, as well as a number of regional television channels. TVM1 is the flagship channel and broadcasts a wide range of programming, including news, current affairs, sports, and entertainment. TVM2 is dedicated to cultural and educational programming, including documentaries, children's shows, and educational series.\n\nORTM also operates a number of national and regional radio stations, including Radio Mali, which is the flagship radio station of the country. Radio Mali broadcasts news, current affairs, sports, and entertainment programming, as well as traditional Malian music and culture.\n\nIn addition to its broadcasting services, ORTM also provides online news and information services through its website.\n\nMission\n\nThe mission of ORTM is to provide high-quality, impartial, and inclusive broadcasting services to the people of Mali. The broadcaster aims to promote national unity, cultural diversity, and social development through its programming. ORTM also seeks to provide a platform for marginalized communities and minority groups to express their views and opinions.\n\nChallenges\n\nLike many public service broadcasters in Africa, ORTM faces a number of challenges, including limited funding, outdated equipment, and competition from private broadcasters. The broadcaster also faces challenges in reaching remote and rural areas, where access to electricity and television sets is limited.\n\nDespite these challenges, ORTM remains a vital institution in Mali, providing a platform for national dialogue, cultural expression, and social development. The broadcaster continues to work towards improving its services and expanding its reach, with the aim of becoming a leading media organization in West Africa.\n\nReferences\n\n1. \"Office de Radiodiffusion-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision du Mali (ORTM)\".

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Claudia Ruggerini\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Claudia Ruggerini (and also known as \"Marisa\" 1 February 1922 Milan - 4 June 2016 Rome) was an Italian partisan, activist, doctor, and neuropsychiatrist. During World War II, she joined the Italian Communist Party to overthrow the government of Benito Mussolini in July 1943.\n\nEarly life and family\nClaudia Ruggerini was an Italian neuropsychiatrist, partisan, activist, and physician born in Milan, the former Italian Kingdom, in 1922. Claudia was born into a poor family in Via Padova 36, which was a street of immigrants in the 1920s. Her family was from Brianza. \nHer mother worked as a masseuse and later as a free trader, while her grandmother was a foundling. The women in Claudia\u2019s childhood are what drove and inspired her. Later in life, Claudia always credited her mother\u2019s work ethic and intelligence while looking back on her past academic and professional opportunities. Claudia\u2019s father was a part of the Italian Communist Party. \nHer father was beaten to death in 1934 by a fascists patrol in front of his house when Claudia was just twelve years old. Claudia watched her father from the window as he was horrifically beaten and left for dead.\n\nShe referred to herself as \u201ca nerd,\u201d as she was incredibly studious and had a love for the arts. This love for the arts is what precipitated her determination to bring awareness to anti-fascism. In Venice, where her Mother went to massage rich clients, Claudia went to churches, to the Biennale of art, and to see films of the film festival, which could not circulate in the fascist and provincial Italy. Claudia\u2019s rebellious nature could be seen in her character since early childhood. In Kindergarten, Claudia\u2019s teachers discovered that she was left-handed, a calamity that, at the time, needed to be \u201ccorrected.\u201d While the teachers succeeded in retraining Claudia to use her right hand, this encounter seemed to awaken the \u201crebel\u201d in her. Her rebellious, witty nature is what eventually propelled her to join the Milanese anti-fascist resistance against Benito Mussolini\n\nEducation\nWhen Claudia started high school, a teacher directed her to the humanities, and in one session, she obtained her teaching diploma in classical studies. Afterwards, Claudia began her studies at University of Industrial Chemistry, then switching her focal point to medicine in 1942. When at the university, she met Hans, who was her \"sweetheart\", and (as she would only discover after the war) had emigrated from Vienna because he was a Jew. Claudia then joined the Garibaldi Brigade, the fifth column on behalf of the CLN inside San Vittore. Hans, in fact, had been locked up there, and through a fortuitous series of events, Claudia won the trust of the Germans who ran the prison. She stated \"I was living in fear.\" Despite the fear, she did not give up, risking the worst.\nUpon studying medicine, Claudia met several anti-fascist students. In July 1943, Claudia met the leader of the Neapolitan Communist Party Antonio D'Ambrosio, one of the most respected and popular leaders of the Milanese resistance, and alongside her fellow anti-fascist peers, Claudia diligently began to fight for the cause, clearly inspired by the horrific death of her father. She was the only woman in the initiative committee, among intellectuals that the Communist D'Ambrosio, a member of the CLN (Committee for National Liberation), had set up.\n\nContributions and Communist Party activism \nClaudia joined the clandestine Communist Party of Naples. She surrounded herself with like minded young people, joining a group of artists, writers, and journalists, great architects, painters, sculptors, poets, and art critics who inspired one another through meetings to encourage passion and creativity, harbingers of new culture, and planning. Above all, the group pushed one another to never give up hope on fighting for the cause. Her peers played an important role as a source of training and cultural enrichment. Many of these great minds would become close friends of Claudia\u2019s that stuck by her throughout her lifetime, as they met throughout the Resistance and continued to inspire each other. In 1953, Claudia went as part of a delegation to visit Picasso, to convince him, which she did successfully, to grant the first major exhibition of his work held in Milan. Claudia accepted the incredibly risky tasks of underground press distribution and the delivery of weapons to the partisans of Valdossola. She was a great risk taker and extremely proactive in the Resistance, acting fearlessly by distributing underground press materials, passing messages by bicycle, delivering weapons, and stealing valuable anti-fascist intelligence from the Prison of San Vittore.\n\nPost-fascist regime \nAfter the fascist regime ended in Italy on April 25, 1947, the resistance declared a long-awaited victory, while Claudia and friends entered Milan\u2019s newsroom to memorialize the liberation of the major media.  Claudia knew Vittorini well, became a friend of Alfonso Gatto, and with them she occupied the editorial office of Corriere della Sera on April 25, to bring out the first issue of the no longer fascist newspaper. \"The last political mission,\" Claudia said, \"I made it in '53. When we went to Picasso's Cote d'Azur with D'Ambrosio and Reale, to convince him to lend Guernica to Milan for the exhibition they were dedicating to him in the Palazzo Reale. At a certain moment, Jean Cocteau also arrived. It was a wonderful day\"\nThis brand new, \u201cfree\u201d edition of the Evening Courier was published that same day.\nThe main ideals of the Resistance were the conquest of liberty, the defeat of the fascists, and the expulsion of the Germans, which were achieved. With liberation and victory assured, Claudia continued her clinical schooling, concentrating on psychoanalytic treatment in children and neuropsychiatry, as she completed her thesis entitled \u201cThe Technique of Psychoanalytic Treatment in Childhood\u201d(1949). Soon after, she met Professor Bruno Noll, who later became her husband. Afterwards, Claudia enrolled at the University of Pavia, with a specialty in Neuropsychiatry, then finishing her course of study in 1952. Claudia expressed wanting to make her contribution towards the renewal of society, as she engaged exclusively in the Public Institutions of Health. Working as a Consultant Neurologist in Milan, she worked her way up in neurology for 33 years, earning the title of Chief Neurologist at the hospital Passirana Rho in Milan.\n\nLater academic accomplishments \nClaudia became notable for her work with children, as she formulated and encouraged the revolutionary opinion that children with mental or neurological disorders could be integrated effectively into normal schools. In a 2016 interview, Claudia reflected on her experiences with children during that time. \u201cIn the clinic I was alone with the child and his relatives (even the nurse came out), I took off the white coat (always a source of fright), placed on the carpet a large box of toys and watched the child choose and play. Then I visited. Often such children were sent to \u2018special schools\u2019, which only enrolled patients with neurological or mental disorders. These were not appropriate schools for children who had an educational or cultural problem! We undertook great fights with some school principals to get the \"non-pathological\" children integrated into normal schools, yet we obtained excellent results.\u201d Upon her retirement in 1987, Claudia was awarded the title of \u201cEmeritus Chief of Neurology,\u201d and continued her work at the hospital as a volunteer for ten years. She continuously stated her belief that the profession was to be a \u201cservice\u201d to the community.\n\nEnd of life contributions and activism \nClaudia felt a personal commitment to serve her community, forever grateful for the opportunities afforded her and humbled by the experience of living under fascism. In 1988, Claudia and her friend Anna Mancini organized a non-profit known as the \u201cTreviso Advar Foundation,\u201d providing at-home care for terminally ill cancer patients, alongside nursing and medical teams, in addition to training of volunteers. The organization created a warm and welcoming \u201chospice\u201d house with cultural activities for everyone, including the patients. Claudia knew how it felt to be oppressed and to lack freedom, hence why she continued her activism throughout generations. When asked, late in her life, about her role as a freedom fighter, she said, \u201cI know very well what it means not to have freedom (of opinion, of the press, of religion, of movement, etc.), to conquer it and to respect it. It is different for the new generations, who often confuse freedom with license. It is up to adults, even the media, to educate!\u201d Her life was truly one of great sacrifice, risk, determination, love, and kindness. \nClaudia Ruggerini passed away peacefully from natural causes in Rome, Italy, on June 4, 2016.\n\nReferences \n\n1922 births\n2016 deaths\nItalian resistance movement members\nItalian anti-fascists\nItalian psychiatrists\nFemale anti-fascists", "machine_text": " Claudia Ruggerini is an Italian astronomer and professor who has made significant contributions to the field of astrophysics and cosmology. She is currently a professor at the University of Milan and has been recognized for her work on the formation and evolution of galaxies.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nRuggerini was born in 1962 in Milan, Italy. She developed an interest in astronomy at a young age and pursued her passion by studying physics at the University of Milan. She received her laurea degree in physics in 1986 and went on to earn her Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Cambridge in 1990.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter completing her Ph.D., Ruggerini held research positions at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago before joining the faculty at the University of Milan in 1995. She quickly established herself as a leading expert in the field of galaxy formation and evolution, and her research has been recognized with numerous awards and honors.\n\nResearch Contributions\n\nRuggerini's research has focused on understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies, particularly in the early universe. She has used a combination of theoretical models and observations to study the processes that shape galaxy morphology and the properties of galaxy clusters. Her work has contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of dark matter and dark energy in the universe.\n\nOne of Ruggerini's most notable contributions is her work on the formation of the first galaxies. She has proposed a new scenario for the formation of the first galaxies, which suggests that they formed in the early universe through the gravitational collapse of gas and dark matter. This scenario has been supported by observations of quasars and gamma-ray bursts, which provide evidence for the existence of massive galaxies in the early universe.\n\nRuggerini has also made important contributions to our understanding of galaxy clusters. She has shown that galaxy clusters are not random associations of galaxies, but rather they are structured systems that can be used to study the properties of dark matter and dark energy. Her research has provided new insights into the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters and the role of dark energy in their evolution.\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nRuggerini's contributions to the field of astrophysics and cosmology have been recognized with numerous awards and honors. In 2005, she received the Premio Bartolozzi of the Accademia dei Lincei, which is one of the most prestigious awards for scientific research in Italy.

He was the first child of the imperial couple and had five younger siblings. From an early age, Teod\u00f3sio was groomed to succeed his father as emperor, receiving a thorough education in subjects such as history, mathematics, and languages.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Short-path distillation\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Short-path distillation is a distillation technique that involves the distillate traveling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure. Short-path distillation systems  often have a variety of names depending on the manufacturer of the system and what compounds are being distilled within them. A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate traveling from one glass bulb to another, without the need for a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower at reduced pressure than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost on the sides of the apparatus. The Kugelrohr is a kind of a short path distillation apparatus which can contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions. To increase the evaporation rate without increasing temperature there are several modern techniques that increase the surface area of the liquid such as thin film, wiped film or 'wiper' film, and rolled film all of which involve mechanically spreading a film of the liquid over a large surface.\n\nSee also\n Fragrance extraction\n\nReferences\n\nDistillation\nSeparation processes\nLaboratory techniques", "machine_text": " Short-path distillation is a method of distillation that involves the distillation of a liquid mixture through a short path, typically a few centimeters, to separate the components of the mixture based on their boiling points. This method is used to purify chemical compounds and to separate mixtures of liquids that have similar boiling points.\n\nThe process of short-path distillation involves the following steps:\n\n1. Heating the mixture: The mixture to be distilled is heated to a temperature that is higher than the boiling point of the component that is wanted to be separated.\n2. Vaporization: The heat causes the component with the lower boiling point to vaporize and rise as vapor into a condenser.\n3. Condensation: The vapor enters the condenser and is cooled, causing it to condense back into a liquid.\n4. Collection: The condensed liquid is collected in a separate container.\n5. Repeating the process: The process is repeated until all the components of the mixture have been separated.\n\nShort-path distillation is a efficient method for separating mixtures because it uses a short path for the vapor to travel, which reduces the chance of reflux and re-distillation, resulting in a higher purity product. Additionally, it requires less energy and less equipment compared to traditional distillation methods, making it a cost-effective option.\n\nThe advantages of short-path distillation include:\n\n* High purity product: Short-path distillation produces a high purity product because the short path reduces the chance of reflux and re-distillation.\n* Energy efficiency: Short-path distillation requires less energy compared to traditional distillation methods because the vapor has to travel a shorter distance.\n* Cost-effectiveness: Short-path distillation requires less equipment and less energy, making it a cost-effective option.\n* Versatility: Short-path distillation can be used to separate a wide range of mixtures, including those with similar boiling points.\n\nThe disadvantages of short-path distillation include:\n\n* Limited applicability: Short-path distillation is only suitable for separating mixtures that have a significant difference in boiling points.\n* Low yield: Short-path distillation can result in a lower yield compared to traditional distillation methods because the short path can cause some of the vapor to be lost.\n\nExamples of short-path distillation include:\n\n* Separation of ethanol and water: Ethanol and water can be separated using short-path distillation because they have a significant difference in boiling points.\n* Separation of crude oil: Short-path distillation can be used to separate crude oil into its various components, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and lubricating oils.\n\nIn conclusion, short-path distillation is a method of distillation that uses a short path to separate components of a mixture based on their boiling points. It offers several advantages, such as high purity product, energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and versatility. However, it also has some disadvantages, such as limited applicability and low yield.

The two ships in the class may be described as a hybrid between a frigate and military transport ship with multiple role capabilities, with the capacity to be transformed from a combat ship with the firepower of a traditional frigate to a hospital ship within a day.\n\nDesign\nThe class is based on a frigate-like design, but built with an internal multipurpose deck (flex deck) and a stern vehicle ramp. The ships can serve as command platforms for a staff of 75 persons (naval or joint staff) with a containerized command and control centre, transport and base of operations for a company-sized landing force of some 200 soldiers with vehicles. Alternatively, the flex deck can be used for mine-laying operations with a capacity of some 300 mines, or be fitted out for mine-clearing operations and launch and recover mine detecting and clearing equipment via a retractable gantry crane, adjacent to the stern vehicle ramp, which also is used for launching and recovering the fast landing craft. Furthermore, the flex deck can support a containerized hospital or simply transport a number of ISO standard containers or some 55 vehicles, including up to seven MBTs. The ships can carry two landing craft, personnel (LCPs) (Storebro SB90E), two rigid hull inflatable boats and two EH101 helicopters.\n\nThe ships have been designed by a joint team from The Royal Danish Navy (RDN), the Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO) and a group of contractors, primarily Odense Maritime Technology (OMT) to the Royal Danish Navy's requirements for a multi-mission frigate-like ship with an emphasis on flexibility.\n\nThe ships are built to the naval standards of Det Norske Veritas (DNV GL), an international certification body and classification society, heavily utilizing STANAG.\n\nThe design is built with the aim of a large margin for growth over life-cycle, to a relatively low cost of ownership, with open architecture for ease of upgrades, with a high degree of automation allowing smaller crews, and utilizing StanFlex modules that can be shared across several ship classes in service with the Royal Danish Navy.\n\nThe hulls were built in highly competitive commercial shipyards using the latest development in the industries shipbuilding technology and cost-effective production procedures and processes. The outfitting and integration of sensor, communication and weapons systems was primarily carried out \"in-house\" by the RDN and DALO.\n\nThe standard weapons of the Absalon class can be supplemented through the use of StanFlex mission modules. A special weapons deck (nicknamed the 'Bathtub') is designed with five StanFlex module slots. Because of the Bathtub's position, only missile-firing weapons modules can be installed.\n\nHistory\nThe ships were named after two brothers, Esbern Snare and archbishop Absalon, who led the naval campaigns in the 12th century against the Wends, a group of pagan Slavs in northern Germany.\n\nProduction started at Odense Steel Shipyard on 30 April 2003, with the lead ship Absalon laid down on 28 November of that year. Esbern Snare followed on 24 March 2004; they were both launched later that year. They were delivered on 19 October 2004 and 17 April 2005 respectively, and commissioned on 10 January 2005 and 17 June 2005. At this point they had the StanFlex modules installed, but would have to wait until 2007 for full operational capability, with the installation of the 35mm CIWS, Mk32 torpedo launchers and Seagnat/SRBOC decoy systems.\n\nAmong other upgrades the two ships of the Absalon class were fitted with the newer Terma Scanter 6002 to replace the Scanter 2001 in 2020.\n\nFor political reasons, the ships were originally launched as \"Flexible support ships\" to avoid antagonising Russia after the end of the cold war. On the 16th of October 2020, both ships were reclassed as ASW-frigates. Both ships will be upgraded with towed array sonars in addition to the existing, hull-mounted sonar and the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters will be equipped with dipping sonars, sonobuoys and torpedoes. This upgrade is expected to complete in 2026.\n\nList of ships\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Danish Naval History\n Admiral Danish Fleet Headquarters\n Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization\n HDMS Absalon Command and Support Ship - Flexible Support Ship\n Naval Technology\n\nAmphibious warfare vessel classes\n \n \nShips of the Royal Danish Navy\n2004 ships\nFrigate classes", "machine_text": " Absalon-class frigate\n\nThe Absalon-class frigate is a class of frigate used by the Royal Danish Navy. The class is named after the Danish archbishop and statesman Absalon, who lived in the 12th century. The ships were designed and built in Denmark, and they were commissioned in the early 2000s.\n\nDesign and Features\n\nThe Absalon-class frigates are designed to perform a variety of tasks, including anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and humanitarian assistance. They have a length of 137 meters and a beam of 16 meters, and they displace approximately 6,000 tons of water. The ships are powered by a combination of diesel engines and gas turbines, which provide a top speed of over 28 knots.\n\nThe Absalon-class frigates are equipped with a range of advanced sensors and weapons systems. They have a state-of-the-art combat management system, which integrates data from various sensors to provide a comprehensive picture of the battlespace. The ships are also equipped with advanced radar systems, including a phased array radar and a helicopter-based radar system.\n\nThe Absalon-class frigates are also equipped with a variety of weapons systems, including a 76mm main gun, two 23mm autocannons, and eight anti-ship missiles. They also have two triple torpedo tubes and a depth charge launcher for anti-submarine warfare. The ships have a flight deck and hangar for operating helicopters, which can be used for a variety of tasks, including reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare, and search and rescue.\n\nOperational History\n\nThe Absalon-class frigates have been involved in a number of operations since their commissioning. In 2009, the HDMS Absalon was deployed to the Gulf of Aden as part of the international effort to combat piracy in the region. The ship was successful in intercepting and disabling several pirate vessels, and it also provided protection to merchant vessels passing through the area.\n\nIn 2011, the HDMS Absalon was deployed to the Mediterranean as part of the international intervention in Libya. The ship provided support to ground forces and helped to enforce a naval blockade against the Libyan government.\n\nIn recent years, the Absalon-class frigates have been involved in a number of NATO exercises and operations, including the annual Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) exercise and the NATO-led Operation Sea Guardian in the Mediterranean.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Absalon-class frigate is a versatile and powerful warship that has proven its worth in a variety of operational contexts. Its advanced sensors and weapons systems make it well-suited to a range of tasks, from anti-submarine warfare to anti-piracy operations. The ships have also demonstrated their ability to operate effectively in a variety of environments, from the cold waters of the Baltic to the warm waters of the Mediterranean.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Alan E. Cober\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Alan E. Cober (May 18, 1935 \u2013 January 17, 1998), born in New York City was an American illustrator. His artwork appeared in The New York Times, Life,Time and numerous other publications. Cober was inducted into the Illustration Hall of Fame in 2011, thirteen years after his death in 1998. Cober was frequently cited as one of the most innovative illustrators America has ever produced.\n\nEarly life and education\nCober was born in New York City, grew up in the Bronx and attended public schools. In 1952 he attended a preparatory school in Riverdale, the Barnard School for Boys. His father, Sol Walter Cohen was a criminal lawyer for 48 years until his death in 1974. The young artist was close to his father and through him, gained firsthand knowledge of courtrooms, police work and the detention of criminals. This experience would later inform his own views and subsequent art on perceived social inequities. His mother, Molly, was president of the Sarah Starkman League for Retarded Children. During his teenage years, Cober would accompany her as she cared for many children in her care.\n\nCober would initially attend the University of Vermont, but later graduated in 1966 from the School of Visual Arts in New York City\nwhere the young artist would learn the importance of drawing and seeing. Cober was drafted into the Army in April 1958, going through basic training at Fort Dix, he spent the remaining two years of service teaching officers and heading the graphics department at the Special Warfare School, at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Cober would spend those two years drawing and learning and that is where he felt he received his real education.\n\nCareer\nCober was one of a small group of American illustrators who initially brought aspects of modern art into commercial art. His magazine illustrations rejected the existing top-down approach of art direction and embraced a far more expressive and symbolic approach to the subject matter. He did not mimic a passage of text, as was the convention at the time in illustration, but instead embraced artistic interpretation. He was one of a few illustrators during the 1960s to make gritty graphic commentary flourish in the rigid world of American illustration. The credit for works such as Cober's being published goes to art directors who were to bring innovative illustrations to print, notably among them Cipe Pineles at Seventeen, Richard Gangel at Sports Illustrated, and Henry Wolf at Esquire.\n\nCober would be commissioned for work by publications such as LIFE, LOOK, Rolling Stone, Esquire, Newsweek, Science Digest, The Atlantic, The New York Times and covers for Time magazine. His corporate clients included Exxon, CBS, American Airlines, IBM, General Electric, IT and Texaco.\n\nIn addition to illustration, his mediums included painting, printmaking and clay and ceramic sculpture.\n\nVisual journalism\nEarly in his career, Cober traveled the United States working on a commission received from the National Park Service. His drawings were made on site at Mount Rushmore, Thomas Jefferson's home Monticello, the Battle of Gettysburg and Colonial Williamsburg. Cober documented the locations by drawing in his sketchbook. As he would often do throughout his career, each drawing would document his journalistic views and personal feelings that he was experiencing at the given moment.\n\nOn assignment with The New York Times, Cober was provided access to the Willowbrook mental health facility in Staten Island. The assignment was to create two drawings for publication. Cober created fifty, many of which would end up being published in his 1975 book,The Forgotten Society which documented his reaction to conditions for the mentally handicapped, prisoners and the aged in New York state with 92 drawings and was published by Dover Press and featured in People magazine. The book would be reprinted in numerous editions up until 2012 with an introduction by his daughter, Leslie Cober-Gentry.\n\nWhen Cober decided he wanted to do a series of work on circus life, he got in touch with Kenneth Feld, owner of Barnum and Bailey Circus. Agreeable to the idea of Cober drawing the circus, Feld provided him with the credentials necessary to enter backstage. When the circus came to Madison Square Garden,Cober came in to create portraits of the characters and performers he took an interest in. He would become friends with many of the performers as they sat for portraits between their acts. Lou Jacobs was a favorite model of Cober's. Other popular performers who modeled for Cober were Mishu, billed as the \"smallest man on earth\", Philippe Petit, the high-wire artist who would later become famous for his highwire walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in 1974, as well as lion trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Cober drew their living conditions in their trailers, their families and pets, depicting a culture unknown to the audience who could only appreciate the circus from the bleachers.\n\nIn 1982, the Smithsonian Institution commissioned Cober to create a mural in celebration of George Washington's 250th birthday.\n\nAmong his many other notable journalistic assignments were his coverage of the shuttle liftoffs from Cape Canaveral for NASA, the 1980 presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter for TIME, and in 1987 Cober traveled on the press plane to cover Pope John Paul's visit to the United States for Rolling Stone.\n\nHis fascination with mental as well as physical decay and a compassion for social issues formed the foundation of his artistic themes throughout his career. Cober's aim as a visual journalist (which is what he called himself) was to effect change by graphically exposing what he determined as critically important to interpret at the time.\n\nMuseum exhibitions\nIn 1992, the Georgia Museum of Art displayed Cober's work in an exhibition titled Alan E. Cober: suite Georgia. The exhibition title refers to prints Cober completed during 1991 as the Lamar Dodd Professorial Chair at the University Of Georgia. The exhibition included etchings made of such folk artists as Howard Finster, R.A. Miller, Reverend John D. Ruth as well as Georgia tourist attractions such as the statue of Br'er Rabbit in downtown Eatonton, Georgia.\n\nIn 1992, the Katonah Museum of Art would display a thirty-year retrospective of Cober's visual reportage of news, culture and the environment. The exhibition would travel to Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and then to the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts in Alabama. The exhibition was curated by Steven Heller\n\nFour years after his death, an exhibition of his work, titled Alan E. Cober: A Retrospective Afterlife, was organized by the Ringling School of Art and appeared at the University at Buffalo in 2002. The exhibit included over 100 drawings and was on display from February 15 through May 18 of 2002.\n\nBibliography\nCober would illustrate 25 books, two of which made The New York Times Ten Best Illustrated Books: Winter's Eve (1969) and Mr. Corbett's Ghost (1968).

Classes were only held on Thursday and Friday because he flew to Buffalo on Thursday from downstate New York to teach the class, then flew back home on Friday. He also required at least one sketch a day in a personal journal. The assignments were usually 'live', meaning that the whole class' final pieces were submitted to a publication, and they chose one to print. The class took field trips to Toronto to see Henrik Drescher, to Phillip Burke's studio, to the Buffalo Museum to draw, to the Anthropology Lab on Campus to draw (dead creatures, including a dead person). Everything Cober taught centered around drawing. In his life drawing classes he was never interested in having the figure look exactly the way it should in nature. An interesting drawing was more important to him as a teacher.\n\nHe said of his teaching: \"My students call it 'traumatic drawing' because of where I take them to draw.\"\n\nAwards and honors\nIn 2001, family and friends of Cober established the Alan E. Cober Memorial Fund at the University of Buffalo to honor his memory and body of work and to advance graphic illustration.\n\nHe was the youngest artist ever named Artist of the Year by the Artists Guild in New York City, in 1966\n\nIllustration Hall of Fame, Society of Illustrators, 2011\nHamilton King Award, Society of Illustrators, 1969\nTen Gold and two Silver medals, Society of Illustrators\nDistinguished Educator in the Arts Award, Society of Illustrators, 1998\nPresident of the Illustrators Workshop (1974-1993)\n\nReferences\n\n1935 births\n1998 deaths\nArtists from New York City\nAmerican magazine illustrators\nSchool of Visual Arts alumni", "machine_text": " Alan E.

Workman (1835\u20131906) was a pioneer agriculturist in Los Angeles, California, and co-owner of a saddlery there. He also served on the Los Angeles Common Council, the legislative branch of city government in that era.\n\nPersonal\n\nFamily\n\nWorkman was born October 20, 1835, in Missouri, the son of David Workman of Clifton-Penrith, England, and Nancy Hook of Virginia. He had a brother, William H. Workman. Around 1854 the family crossed the Great Plains to settle in Los Angeles.\n\nHe was married three times\u2014first, in Booneville, Missouri, shortly after the Civil War, to Julia C. Benedict (his childhood sweetheart), who died in 1876; then to Gilla Maria Corum of Boonville, in 1878 in Los Angeles; and finally, in 1884, to Anna K. Webb of Los Angeles; she died in 1900. He had two daughters, Gilleta M., and Laura (Mrs. Conrad Krebs).\n\nPersonality\n\nHis biography in the Los Angeles Public Library states that:\n\nElijah H. Workman was of the pioneer type of public figure: he wore boots to his dying day and lacked the more formal education of our times. With the conscientious fulfillment of his public duties[,] he combined the pioneer spirit of enterprise and development.\n\nIn politics he was a Democrat, and in religion a Protestant.\n\nDeath\n\nWorkman died July 17, 1906, at the age of 71 in his home at 1815 East Second Street, Boyle Heights.\n\nVocation\n\nWorkman was in the harness and saddlery business with his brother, William H. Workman, at 76 Main Street. They also dealt in hides, which were recognized as a medium of exchange throughout the Southwest.\n\nReturning from his trip to Missouri, Workman brought back seeds for trees and plants that he propagated in his own yard, getting the reputation of a \"pioneer agriculturalist.\" His property, surrounded by 10th and 11th streets, Hill and Main streets, was planted with orange trees and flowers. He sold that land and moved to Boyle Heights after the death of his third wife.\n\nPublic service\n\nWorkman was a member of the Los Angeles Common Council, the legislative branch of city government, in 1866\u201367, 1869\u201370, 1871\u201372 and 1874\u201375. He was on the city Board of Education in 1879\u201380 and on the Board of Equalization in 1869\u201370.\n\nIn 1870 Workman was a member of a committee to establish a public park, which was accomplished between Fifth and Sixth streets, and Workman planted seedlings from his own garden and nursed them from water hauled in barrels from his property a few blocks away. He planted elms, maples and rubber trees on the park site, first known as Central Park and then as Pershing Square.\n\nSee also\nBoyle-Workman family\nWorkman-Temple family\nWorkman and Temple Family Homestead Museum\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican agriculturalists\nBusinesspeople from Los Angeles\nLos Angeles Common Council (1850\u20131889) members\n1906 deaths\n1835 births\nPoliticians from Los Angeles\n19th-century American politicians\n19th century in Los Angeles\n19th-century American businesspeople", "machine_text": " Elijah H. Workman was an American inventor, businessman, and entrepreneur who made significant contributions to the development of the oil industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is best known for his invention of the Workman pump, a revolutionary oil pump that greatly increased the efficiency and safety of oil production.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nElijah H. Workman was born on October 23, 1850, in Pulaski, New York. He was the youngest of five children born to William Workman, a farmer and blacksmith, and his wife, Mary. Workman grew up in a family that valued education and innovation, and he was encouraged to pursue his interests in mechanics and engineering from a young age.\n\nAfter completing his primary education, Workman attended the Pulaski Academy and later enrolled in the mechanical engineering program at the University of Vermont. However, he did not complete his degree, choosing instead to return to Pulaski and work in his father's machine shop.\n\nIn 1873, Workman moved to Titusville, Pennsylvania, a major center of oil production at the time. He worked as a machinist for several oil companies, including the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company, where he developed his first oil pump.\n\nInvention of the Workman Pump\n\nWorkman's first oil pump was a significant improvement over existing technology, which relied on cumbersome and inefficient steam-powered pumps. His pump was powered by a single cylinder gasoline engine and used a series of valves and cylinders to lift oil from the well to the surface. The pump was simple, reliable, and easy to maintain, making it an instant success in the oil industry.\n\nThe Workman pump quickly became the standard for oil production, and Workman's company, the Workman Pump Company, became one of the largest and most successful oil equipment manufacturers in the world. The pump revolutionized the oil industry, allowing for faster and more efficient extraction of oil and making it possible to extract oil from deeper wells.\n\nOther Inventions and Achievements\n\nIn addition to his work on the oil pump, Workman made several other significant contributions to the oil industry. He invented a number of other oil-related technologies, including a device for measuring oil production, a well-drilling machine, and a safety valve for oil wells.\n\nWorkman was also a successful businessman and entrepreneur. He founded several companies, including the Workman Pump Company, the Titusville Iron Works, and the Pennsylvania Oil Company. He was also a key figure in the development of Titusville, serving as the city's mayor and supporting the construction of roads, schools, and other infrastructure.\n\nAwards and Legacy\n\nWorkman's contributions to the oil industry were widely recognized during his lifetime. He was awarded several patents for his inventions and was honored with numerous awards and accolades, including the John Scott Medal, which he received in 1917 for his contributions to the development of the oil industry.\n\nToday, Workman's legacy lives on through the Workman Pump Company, which continues to operate as a leading manufacturer of oil and gas equipment. His inventions and innovations remain an important part of the oil industry, and his contributions to the development of Titusville and the surrounding region are still celebrated by the community.\n\nIn conclusion, Elijah H. Workman was a brilliant inventor, entrepreneur, and businessman who played a crucial role in the development of the oil industry. His innovative solutions and technologies revolutionized the way oil was extracted and produced, making him one of the most important figures in the history of the oil industry. His legacy continues to inspire and influence the industry today.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 37916557}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nintendo 64 accessories\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Nintendo 64 accessories include first-party Nintendo hardwareand third-party hardware, licensed and unlicensed. Nintendo's first-party accessories are mainly transformative system expansions: the 64DD Internet multimedia platform, with a floppy drive, video capture and editor, game building setup, web browser, and online service; the controller plus its own expansions for storage and rumble feedback; and the RAM-boosting Expansion Pak for big improvements in graphics and gameplay. Third-party accessories include the essential game developer tools built by SGI and SN Systems on Nintendo's behalf, an unlicensed SharkWire online service, and unlicensed cheaper counterparts to first-party items. The Nintendo 64 video game console had a market lifespan from 1996 to 2002.\n\nFirst-party\nFirst-party Nintendo 64 accessories have a product code prefixed with NUS, short for \"Nintendo Ultra Sixty-four\".\n\nController\n\nThe Nintendo 64 controller (NUS-005) is an \"m\"-shaped controller with 10 buttons (A, B, C-Up, C-Down, C-Left, C-Right, L, R, Z, and Start), one analog stick in the center, a digital directional pad on the left side, and an extension port on the back for many of the system's accessories. Initially available in the seven colors of gray, yellow, green, red, blue, purple, and black, and it was later released in translucent versions of those colors except gray.\n\nController Pak\n\nThe  (NUS-004) is the console's memory card, comparable to those seen in the PlayStation and other CD-ROM-based video game consoles. Certain games allow saving of game files to the Controller Pak, which plugs into the back of the Nintendo 64 controller (as do the Rumble and Transfer Paks). The Controller Pak was marketed as a way to exchange data with other Nintendo 64 owners, since information saved on the game cartridge can not be transferred between cartridges.\n\nIt is plugged into the controller and allows the player to save game progress and configuration. The original models from Nintendo offered 256 kilobits (32KB) battery backed SRAM, split into 123 pages with a limitation of 16 save files, but third-party models have much more, often in the form of 4 selectable memory banks of 256kbits. The number of pages that a game occupies varies, sometimes using the entire card. It is powered by a common CR2032 battery.\n\nUpon launch, the Controller Pak was initially useful, and even necessary for earlier Nintendo 64 games. Over time, the Controller Pak lost popularity to the convenience of a battery backed SRAM or EEPROM found in some cartridges. Because the Nintendo 64 uses a Game Pak cartridge format that allows saving data on the cartridge itself, few first-party and second-party games use the Controller Pak. The vast majority are from third-party developers. This is most likely due to the increased production and retail costs which would have been caused by including self-contained data on the cartridge. Some games use it to save optional data that is too large for the cartridge, such as Mario Kart 64, which uses 121 of the total 123 pages for storing ghost data, or International Superstar Soccer 64, which uses up the entire cartridge's space for its save data. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater uses 11 pages. Quest 64 and Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon use the Controller Pak exclusively for saved data. The Japan-only game Animal Forest uses the Controller Pak to travel to other towns.\n\nFollowing the 1996 Christmas Shopping Season, Next Generation reported \"impressive sales of the memory pack cartridges despite the lack of available games to take advantage of the $19.99 units\".\n\nJumper Pak \n\nThe Jumper Pak (NUS-008) is a filler that plugs into the console's memory expansion port. It serves no functional purpose other than to terminate the Rambus bus in the absence of the Expansion Pak. This is functionally equivalent to a continuity RIMM in a Rambus motherboard filling the unused RIMM sockets until the user upgrades. Nintendo 64 consoles were shipped with the Jumper Pak included and already installed. Jumper Paks were not sold individually in stores and could only be ordered through Nintendo's online store. The system requires the Jumper Pak when the Expansion Pak is not present or else there will be no picture on the TV screen.\n\nExpansion Pak\n\nThe  (NUS-007) consists of 4\u00a0MB (megabytes) of random access memory (RAM)\u2014which is RDRAM, the same type of memory used inside the console itself\u2014increasing the Nintendo 64 console's RAM from 4\u00a0MB to 8\u00a0MB of contiguous main memory. It is installed in a port on top of the console and replaces the pre-installed Jumper Pak, which is simply a Rambus terminator. Originally designed to accompany the 64DD disk drive expansion peripheral for its larger multimedia workstation applications, the Expansion Pak was launched separately in Q4 1998 and then bundled with the 64DD's delayed December 1999 Japan launch package. The Expansion Pak was bundled with Donkey Kong 64, and in Japan, the Expansion Pak additionally came bundled with The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask and Perfect Dark, though the games have been also available separately in other regions.\n\nIt was bundled with an \"ejector tool\" (NUS-012) meant for removing the original Jumper Pak.\n\nGame developers found ways to take advantage of the increased memory, including greater visual appeal. The Expansion Pak is required in order to run both Donkey Kong 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. A third game, Perfect Dark, blocks access to content, including the single-player campaign, when no Expansion Pak is present, with the back cover of the game's packaging stating that \"approximately 35%\" of the game is available in that case. It is also required for all 64DD software. In StarCraft 64, it is needed to unlock levels from the Brood War add-on from the PC version of the game. The Nintendo 64 all-remade version of Quake II features higher color depth and better performance, but not a higher resolution when using the Expansion Pak. Finally, in the vast majority of games with support, such as Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness and Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, the expansion pak is merely used as additional frame buffer memory to enable various high-resolution (usually interlaced) mode options, at the downside of poorer performance, in some cases dramatically so. This use of the Expansion Pak can be attributed to ease of implementation and games that mainly targeted the stock N64 configuration; additional RDRAM cannot be easily used to circumvent other bottlenecks of the console, such as the small texture cache. Also, the  of Space Station Silicon Valley may crash in certain places if the Expansion Pak is present.\n\nIGN celebrated the Nintendo 64 industry's methods in launching and supporting the Expansion Pak for making a high-impact accessory with \"immediate and noticeable\", though mostly optional, effects.\n\nRumble Pak\n\nThe  (NUS-013) provides haptic feedback to the player by way of vibration. It is powered by two AAA batteries and connects to the controller's expansion port. It was released in 1997 for the new game Star Fox 64, with which it was originally bundled.\n\nTransfer Pak\n\nThe Transfer Pak (NUS-019) plugs into the controller to transfer data between supported Nintendo 64 games and Game Boy or Game Boy Color games. It has a Game Boy Color slot and a part that fits onto the expansion port of the N64 controller. It was included with the game Pok\u00e9mon Stadium.\n\nIn Japan it is called \"64GB\" as Shigeru Miyamoto described at Nintendo's Space World 1997 trade show. It was a key feature of the infamous creature raising game prototype that was never released, Cabbage.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Stadium and Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2 are games that rely heavily on the Transfer Pak, as the games' main feature is importing Pok\u00e9mon teams from the Game Boy games. Pok\u00e9mon Stadium also includes a \"GB Tower\" mode for playing Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, and Yellow directly on the Nintendo 64 via a built-in Game Boy emulator.\n\nThe Japanese version of the Game Boy Camera can be connected to the Mario Artist series. Mario Golf and Mario Tennis allow players to transfer their created characters from the Game Boy Color versions to the Nintendo 64 versions via the Transfer Pak. Rare's Perfect Dark was initially going to be compatible with the Transfer Pak in order to use pictures taken with the Game Boy Camera to create characters with real-life faces, but this function was removed from development after the attacks at Columbine High School and a wave of anti-violent video game sentiment; the Transfer Pak is usable only in combination with the Game Boy Color version of Perfect Dark for unlocking bonuses.\n\nWide-Boy64\n\nDeveloped by Intelligent Systems, the Wide-Boy64 is a series of adapters similar to the Super Game Boy that was able to play Game Boy games. The device was never sold in retail to general consumers and was only provided to developers and the gaming press. Two major versions of Wide-Boy64 were released: the CGB, which could play Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, and the updated AGB, which could also play Game Boy Advance game paks. It also allowed the gaming press to capture screen shots more easily. Like the Super Game Boy and Game Boy Player, the game screen is surrounded by a template mimicking the appearance of the portable system. This device was used for final matches at the Pok\u00e9mon League Summer Training Tour '99. Developers and magazines could purchase one directly from Nintendo at a cost of $1400 apiece. The Canadian children's game show Video & Arcade Top 10 used Wide-Boy64 adapters so contestants could play Game Boy titles on some later episodes.\n\nS-Video Cable\nThe S-Video cable provides a better quality picture than composite RCA cables via the MultiAV port. The NTSC cable is identical to and compatible with earlier SNES (NTSC/PAL) and later GameCube (NTSC-only) S-Video cables. The first-party NTSC Nintendo 64 S-Video cable sold by Nintendo, however, was not produced in PAL regions. The PAL Nintendo 64 does natively output S-Video (Luma/Chroma), but require a different cable to NTSC Nintendo 64 due to a design difference in most or all PAL motherboard revisions. Nintendo never released an official S-Video cable for the PAL console. Using an NTSC S-Video cable on a PAL console will usually produce over-bright, garish colors; or it may not produce any video image at all.\n\nThird-party S-Video cables for both the NTSC and PAL consoles were produced, though it is important to note that many cheaper S-Video cables do not deliver a true S-Video signal, merely passing the composite video signal (the yellow plug of the standard red/white/yellow AV cables) through the S-Video plug.\n\n64DD\n\nThe 64DD (NUS-010) is a  floppy drive with real-time clock, font and audio library in ROM, and a bundle of other accessories and custom games. The peripheral was initially announced in 1995, planned for release in 1997, and repeatedly delayed until its release in December 1999.  It was launched alongside a now defunct online service called Randnet. With nine games released, it was a commercial failure and was consequently never released outside Japan.\n\nMouse\n\nThe mouse (NUS-017) was developed for the 64DD's GUI-based games and applications, such the Mario Artist suite, SimCity 64, and the web browser for Nintendo's defunct online service Randnet. It was manufactured by Mitsumi and bundled with the 64DD's launch game, Mario Artist: Paint Studio. It works with the Game Pak\n\nVRU\n\nThe VRU or Voice Recognition Unit (NUS-020, NUS-021, NUS-022, and NUS-025) is compatible with only two games: Hey You, Pikachu! and Densha de Go! 64. Hey You, Pikachu! is packaged with the VRU and requires it, but Densha de Go! 64 does not and is sold separately. The VRU consists of a ballast (NUS-020) connected to controller port 4 of the system, a microphone (NUS-021), a yellow foam cover for the microphone, and a clip for clipping the microphone to the controller (NUS-025, bundled with Hey You, Pikachu!) or a plastic neck holder for hands free usage (NUS-022, bundled with Densha de Go! 64). The VRU is calibrated for best recognition of a high-pitched voice, such as a child's voice. As a result, the voices of adults and teenagers are less likely be recognized properly by the VRU.\n\nVRUs are region dependent, and a USA region VRU cannot be used with Japanese games and vice versa (foreign region VRUs are not detected by the games). No VRU compatible game was launched in the EUR region (PAL, Europe), so there is no EUR-region VRU. A similar device was also released for the Wii called the Wii Speak.\n\nCleaning Kit\nThe cleaning kit (NUS-014, NUS-015, and NUS-016) contains materials to clean the connectors of the Control Deck, controllers, Game Paks, Rumble Paks, and Controller Paks.\n\nRF Switch and RF Modulator\n\nThe RF Switch and RF Modulator (NUS-009 and NUS-003) allow the Nintendo 64 and model 2 SNES (redesigned after the launch of the Nintendo 64) to hook up to the television through RF. It was primarily intended for customers with older televisions that lack AV cable support. Since the Nintendo 64 and model 2 SNES lack built-in RF compatibility, the modulator acts as a special adapter that plugs into the Nintendo 64's AV port to give the Nintendo 64 RF compatibility. The RF switch itself is identical in every way to the RF switches released for Nintendo's prior systems (the NES and the SNES) and can be interchanged if needed. This set was later re-released for the GameCube to give it RF capability. The cables intended for the GameCube will also work with the Nintendo 64 and SNES.\n\nEuro Connector Plug\nThe Euro Connector Plug is an adaptor packaged with European releases of the console, which converts RCA composite and stereo cable inputs to Composite SCART.\n\nVideo capture cassette\nThe video capture cassette, or cartridge, (NUS-028) for use on the  64DD game series. The back of the cartridge has audio, video, and microphone input jacks through which it can collect video and audio data. It was bundled with the 64DD game.\n\nModem\nThe modem cartridge (NUS-029) connects at up to , formerly for use with the Randnet service and compatible 64DD games and web browser.\n\nPower supply\nThe power supply (NUS-002, UKV-EUR-AUS-JPN-USA) provides electricity to the Control Deck.\n\nKeyboard\nThe compact keyboard is for use with the Randnet service and compatible 64DD games.\n\nSmartMedia\n\nSmartMedia memory cards for use with the game  contain images, backgrounds, borders, and other media assets to be used while editing the user photos.\nThere are at least six different cards:\n Illustrations - \n Illustrations - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n Characters collection - \n\nThe cards are all 3.3\u00a0V 2\u00a0MB SmartMedia memory cards manufactured by Hagiwara Sys-Com. The Mario no Photopi game was bundled with an empty memory SmartMedia card for storing the user creations.\n\nLicensed\n\nASCIIWHEEL 64\nThe ASCIIWHEEL 64 is an alternate controller shaped as a steering wheel for driving games.

They continued to play well throughout the season, with star players such as Frank Boucher, Earl Seibert, and Murray Murdoch leading the way. The team's offense was particularly strong, scoring 125 goals in their 48 games, which was the second-highest total in the league.\n\nThe Rangers' success on the ice was not limited to their on-ice play. The team also made headlines off the ice, as they became the first NHL team to host a game at the newly-built Madison Square Garden. The arena, which was located in the heart of Manhattan, was a state-of-the-art facility that held over 18,000 fans. The Rangers' first game at the Garden was played on November 16, 1935, and the team defeated the Montreal Canadiens 2-1 in front of a sold-out crowd.\n\nAs the season progressed, the Rangers continued to play well and found themselves in a tight race for the league's second playoff spot. The team's strong play was led by Boucher, who finished the season with 22 goals and 45 points, which was second in the league in scoring. The Rangers also had a strong goaltending tandem in Mike Karakas and Dave Kerr, who both played well throughout the season.\n\nThe Rangers' hard work and dedication paid off, as they finished the season with a 24-20-4 record, which was good enough for second place in the league. The team's strong finish earned them a spot in the Stanley Cup Finals, where they faced off against the Detroit Red Wings. The series was a closely contested one, with the Rangers ultimately falling in six games. Despite the loss, the Rangers' appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals was a positive sign for the team and their fans, and it marked the beginning of a successful era for the franchise.\n\nOverall, the 1935-36 New York Rangers season was a successful one, as the team rebounded from a disappointing season the year before and made a strong push for the Stanley Cup.

The Seminoles were led by head coach Leonard Hamilton, who was in his 17th season with the team. They played their home games at the Donald L. Tucker Center in Tallahassee, Florida and were members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\n\nThe Seminoles finished the season with a record of 29-8, 13-5 in ACC play, which tied for third place in the conference. They were invited to the NCAA Tournament, where they lost in the second round to Gonzaga.\n\nFlorida State was led by a trio of senior guards, Terance Mann, PJ Savoy, and Braian Angola-Rodas. Mann was the team's leading scorer and rebounder, averaging 16.9 points and 6.4 rebounds per game. Savoy was the team's second-leading scorer, averaging 14.2 points per game, while Angola-Rodas averaged 12.8 points and 4.8 rebounds per game.\n\nThe Seminoles had a strong start to the season, winning their first 12 games, including victories over defending national champion Villanova and rival Florida. They continued to play well in conference play, winning 10 of their first 12 games and rising to as high as #12 in the AP Poll. However, they struggled down the stretch, losing four of their final six regular season games, which dropped them to a tie for third place in the ACC standings.\n\nIn the ACC Tournament, Florida State lost to Duke in the quarterfinals, but still received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. They were seeded 17th in the West Region and faced off against 13th-seeded Vermont in the first round. The Seminoles won that game 76-69, behind 21 points from Savoy, but were eliminated in the second round by 10th-seeded Gonzaga, who scored a game-winning basket with 1.1 seconds remaining to win 72-70.\n\nThe season was considered a success for the Seminoles, who had high expectations after returning several key players from the previous year's Sweet 16 team. They finished the season with their highest win total since the 2011-2012 season and their highest seeding in the NCAA Tournament since 1992.\n\nAfter the season, Mann and Savoy both graduated and moved on to professional careers, while Angola-Rodas elected to transfer to another school for his final season of eligibility. The Seminoles also brought in a highly-regarded recruiting class, featuring five-star forward Patrick Williams, who was expected to contribute immediately in the 2019-2020 season.\n\nOverall, the 2018-19 Florida State Seminoles men's basketball team had a successful season, despite falling short of their goals in the NCAA Tournament. They were one of the most consistent programs in the ACC during the 2010s and were well-positioned to continue their success in the future.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 58268364}

It is the 87th film in ESPN's 30 for 30 series. The film was aired on ESPN directly after the 2016 Heisman Award Ceremony and premiered to over 2 million viewers, making it the highest rated 30 for 30 film since 2015.  At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards it was one of that season's 30 for 30 films nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nBackground \nIn 1985, a rivalry started between the University of Notre Dame and University of Miami football teams after the Miami Hurricanes beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 58\u20137. This loss marked head coach Gerry Faust's last game at Notre Dame.\n\nThe rivalry culminated in a showdown three years later, which was dubbed \"Catholics vs. Convicts.\" The name originated from a t-shirt slogan created by Notre Dame students Joe Frederick and Michael Caponigro. The slogan played on Notre Dame's Catholic background and the public perception of Miami's players as college football's \"bad boys,\" a reputation that was reinforced by the arrests of a number of Miami players. Both the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Miami Hurricanes came into the game undefeated. Cleveland Gary's controversial \"phantom fumble\" is examined closely in the film.  While studying the game the filmmakers re-examined a second close call by the referees which had gone largely unnoticed at the time.  Both coaches and several players from the game had never seen the replay, leading many of the subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. Many sportswriters consider it one of the greatest college football games of all time.\n\nThe documentary is partially based on director Patrick Creadon's experience as a Notre Dame undergraduate at the time. Creadon was a senior at Notre Dame in 1988 and knew the students behind the \"Catholics vs. Convicts\" slogan.\n\nCast \nCreadon went back to interview several of his classmates for the documentary, including Patrick Walsh, his best friend from high school who was involved in the t-shirt scandal, and Tony Rice, the starting quarterback who lived down the hall from them in Dillon Hall. The film also features interviews with head coaches Lou Holtz and Jimmy Johnson; Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez; Notre Dame players Chris Zorich, Pat Eilers, Pat Terrell, and Todd Lyght, among others; and Miami players Steve Walsh, Cleveland Gary, and Leon Searcy, among others.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson called Catholics vs. Convicts a \"gripping gridiron drama.\" Sporting News ranks the film \"among the best\" of the 30 for 30 franchise.\n\nReferences \n\nNotre Dame vs. Miami\nMiami Hurricanes football\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish football\n30 for 30\n2016 television films", "machine_text": " Catholics vs. Convicts (2016 film)\n\nCatholics vs. Convicts is a 2016 American comedy film directed by J. Van Auken and written by Jamie Moss. The film stars Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, and Jermaine Clement.\n\nThe film is set in the fictional town of Cretchville, where a group of convicts, led by the charismatic and unstable Danny (played by Jermaine Clement), have been released from prison and are looking to start a new life. However, their plans are thwarted when they are met with resistance from the local Catholic church, led by the tight-fisted and judgmental Father Mike (played by Steve Carell).\n\nThe convicts, who have been branded with a distinctive tattoo of the Virgin Mary, are seen as outcasts by the community and are shunned by the church. Father Mike is determined to keep the convicts out of his church and away from his flock, while Danny is equally determined to prove that they are capable of change and deserving of redemption.\n\nAs the conflict between the convicts and the church escalates, a series of hilarious and absurd events unfold. The convicts, who are struggling to find employment and housing, turn to unconventional means to make ends meet, including selling stolen goods on the black market and participating in a series of bizarre schemes.\n\nMeanwhile, Father Mike is dealing with his own personal crisis, as he struggles to come to terms with his own faith and the hypocrisy of the church. He is tormented by his own doubts and fears, and is ultimately forced to confront the harsh realities of the world around him.\n\nThe film also stars Paul Rudd as Tim, a well-meaning but dim-witted church volunteer who becomes embroiled in the conflict between the convicts and the church. Rudd brings his signature comedic timing and charm to the role, and his character serves as a foil to the more serious themes of the film.\n\nThroughout the film, the theme of redemption is explored in a humorous and satirical way. The convicts are shown to be flawed but ultimately good-hearted individuals who are capable of change, while the church is portrayed as rigid and unyielding. The film pokes fun at the hypocrisy of organized religion and the ways in which it can be used to justify discrimination and exclusion.\n\nThe film was released to positive reviews from critics, who praised its humor and satire. The performances of the cast, particularly those of Carell and Clement, were also widely praised. The film has since become a cult classic and is often cited as an example of a successful comedy film that tackles serious themes in a humorous and irreverent way.\n\nIn conclusion, Catholics vs. Convicts is a hilarious and thought-provoking film that explores themes of redemption, hypocrisy, and the human condition. With its talented cast, sharp writing, and satirical tone, it is a must-see for fans of comedy and social commentary.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 65834020}

The artist's most popular motive was the Scottish highlands. Joel was a much respected artist during the Victorian and Edwardian era, valued especially for the vibrancy of his palette and 'flowing', 'sophisticated' brush strokes, yet was largely forgotten (and underestimated) in the late 20th and early 21st century. A prolific artist, his work is often seen on the market today. He has been sold at Bonhams, Sotheby's and Christies and has seen increasing popularity by collectors.\n\nBates Joel exhibited from 1884 to 1922 and is catalogued as H B Joel, J H Boel and H Bates'' as his signatures are \"monogrammed with initials and difficult to read.\" This has led to Henry Bates Joel sometimes being referred to as John Henry Boel in auctions and on some portals; there is limited evidence that Boel was his actual name, but this is subject to speculation. Early examples of his paintings (during the 1890s) are usually dated, which is not the case for his later works.\n\nJoel is part of the 'late romantic movement', aimed at supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values. Bates will have been inspired by the likes of Turner and Constable, adding a 'contemporary, Victorian, perspective' to traditional imagery. Paintings such as 'Loch Lomod' are typical for Bates Joel's style; \"refined and vibrant yet with strongly romanticised aura.\" Henry Bates Joel's primary medium of painting was oil but many watercolours exist as well.\n\nJoel also painted the Isle of Wight, some of his paintings (such as 'Bonchurch, near Ventnor, Isle of Wight', which shows an impressionist influence) are exhibited in Milntown Estate.

He was the son of a merchant, and his family had a strong interest in natural history. Joel was educated at home, where he developed a passion for entomology and conchology. He also attended lectures at the Royal Institution, where he was exposed to the works of Charles Darwin and other prominent naturalists of the time.\n\nExploration of the Amazon\n\nIn 1878, Joel traveled to the Amazon rainforest as a naturalist on a expedition led by Colonel John Blankley. The expedition was sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society, and its goal was to explore the upper Amazon and its tributaries. Joel spent several years in the Amazon, collecting and studying the fauna of the region. He was particularly interested in the butterflies and moths of the Amazon, and his collection of over 30,000 specimens is considered one of the most important collections of its kind.\n\nContributions to Science\n\nJoel's work in the Amazon led to several significant contributions to the field of natural history. He discovered several new species of butterflies and moths, and his observations on their habits and habitats helped to shed light on the evolution of these species. He also studied the behavior and ecology of other animals, including birds, mammals, and reptiles.\n\nOne of Joel's most important contributions was his work on the theory of mimicry in animals. He observed that many species of butterflies and moths in the Amazon had evolved to mimic the appearance of other animals or plants, in order to protect themselves from predators. This phenomenon, known as Batesian mimicry, is named after Joel and his work on the subject.\n\nLater Life and Legacy\n\nJoel returned to England in 1886, where he continued to study and write about his experiences in the Amazon. He published several books and articles on the fauna of the region, and his work helped to inspire future generations of naturalists and explorers.\n\nJoel was also an active member of several scientific societies, including the Royal Geographical Society and the Entomological Society of London. He was awarded several honors for his work, including the Royal Geographical Society's Patron's Medal in 1887.\n\nHenry Bates Joel died on February 16, 1934, at the age of 74. His legacy as a naturalist and explorer continues to be celebrated today, and his work on the fauna of the Amazon remains an important contribution to the field of natural history.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Bates, H.

During the dictatorship of Franco, in 1956, it was created the Spanish Institute for Emigration in order to control the emigration of the Spanish population, trying to direct it to countries with cultural links like South American's. This was done through collecting labor information abroad to offer Spaniards more attractive jobs in this type of countries.\n\nIn 1985, the Institute was transformed into a Directorate-General being called Directorate-General of the Spanish Institute for Emigration.

Prior to this, the colony had been governed by a mixture of military officers and appointed officials, but with the growth of the population and the expansion of settlements, there was a growing need for a more formal system of government. The new parliament, which was established in May 1865, consisted of 21 members, who were elected by the people to represent their interests. This marked a significant step towards self-government for the colony, and paved the way for the eventual establishment of a federal government in Australia.\n\nAnother important political development in 1865 was the granting of responsible government to the colony of Victoria. This meant that the colony was now able to govern itself, without the need for intervention from the British government. The first premier of Victoria, Sir Charles Darling, was appointed in November 1865, and he played a key role in shaping the colony's future.\n\nEconomic Developments\n\n1865 was also a significant year for the economy of Australia. The discovery of gold in the colony of Victoria in 1851 had led to a period of rapid growth and expansion, as thousands of people flocked to the goldfields in search of riches. However, by 1865, the gold rush was beginning to slow down, and the economy was starting to diversify. Agriculture and sheep farming became increasingly important, and the first frozen meat shipments were sent to Britain from Australia in 1865. This marked the beginning of a new era in Australian trade, and laid the foundations for the country's future prosperity.\n\nSocial Developments\n\nIn addition to political and economic developments, 1865 was also a significant year for social change in Australia. The colony of New South Wales passed the Married Women's Property Act, which gave women the right to own and manage property in their own name. This was a major step towards women's rights, and paved the way for future progress in this area.\n\nThe year 1865 also saw the establishment of the first public library in Australia, in the city of Melbourne. This marked a significant milestone in the development of education and culture in the country, and provided a valuable resource for the people of Melbourne.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, 1865 was a year of significant progress and development in Australia. The establishment of formal parliaments, the granting of responsible government, and the diversification of the economy were all important milestones in the country's history. Additionally, the Married Women's Property Act and the establishment of the first public library marked important steps towards social progress and cultural development. Overall, 1865 was a year that laid the foundations for the future prosperity and growth of Australia.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12751767}

It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7\u20135.6\u00a0AU once every 11 years and 6 months (4,213 days; semi-major axis of 5.1\u00a0AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 22\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first observation as  at Turku Observatory in December 1940, more than 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek hero Teucer, from Greek mythology. The son of King Telamon was a great archer and half-brother of Ajax, with whom he fought alongside in the Trojan War. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 17 February 1984 ().\n\nPhysical characteristics \n\nTeucer has been characterized as a dark D-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS' survey as well as in the SDSS-based taxonomy. It is also an assumed C-type asteroid.\n\nRotation period \n\nSeveral rotational lightcurves of Teucer have been obtained from photometric observations since 1992.

It is named after the legendary ancient Greek archer Teucer, who fought alongside his father Telamon in the Trojan War.\n\nThe asteroid is a member of the Themis family, a large group of asteroids that share similar orbital characteristics and are thought to have originated from a common parent body. Teucer orbits the Sun at an average distance of 2.78 astronomical units (AU), and takes about 4.5 years to complete one orbit. Its orbit is slightly inclined, with an inclination of about 2 degrees, and it has a moderate eccentricity of 0.12.\n\nTeucer is a relatively small asteroid, with a diameter of about 30 kilometers. It is thought to be a primitive, carbonaceous chondrite asteroid, meaning that it is composed primarily of silicates and organic materials. These types of asteroids are believed to have formed in the early days of the Solar System, and are considered to be some of the most primitive objects in the asteroid belt.\n\nIn 2000, a team of astronomers led by Dr. David Trilling of the University of California, Berkeley, observed Teucer using the Keck II telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. They found that the asteroid has a rotation period of about 6.6 hours, which is relatively slow compared to other asteroids of similar size. This suggests that Teucer may have a highly elongated shape, or that it is in contact with another object and is tidally locked, meaning that one side of the asteroid constantly faces the other object.\n\nIn 2011, Teucer was the target of a radar observation campaign by NASA's Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California. The radar observations revealed that the asteroid has a highly irregular shape, with a long, narrow elongation and a sizeable depression on its surface. The observations also suggested that Teucer may have a satellite in orbit around it, although this has not been confirmed.\n\nIn conclusion, 2797 Teucer is a minor planet that offers a fascinating glimpse into the early days of the Solar System. Its slow rotation, irregular shape, and possible satellite make it a unique object of study, and its composition may hold clues to the origins of life on Earth. As scientists continue to study Teucer and other asteroids in the Themis family, they may uncover even more secrets about the formation and evolution of our Solar System.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14941142}

Many opposition parties and candidates were barred from running, and there were widespread reports of irregularities on election day.\n\nDespite these controversies, the election saw a high turnout, with over 70% of eligible voters casting their ballots. The Islamic Republican Party won a landslide victory, taking 194 of the 270 seats in the Assembly. The party's leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, declared the election a \"great victory\" for the Iranian people and a \"defeat\" for the country's enemies.\n\nThe election was widely seen as a test of support for the Islamic Republic and its policies, and the result was interpreted as a show of strength for the ruling party. However, the allegations of fraud and vote-rigging marred the legitimacy of the election, and many opposition groups and human rights organizations criticized the outcome as undemocratic.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, the Islamic Consultative Assembly convened for the first time on May 21, 1984.

Living during the chaotic Spring and Autumn period, as the Zhou dynasty's former vassal states fought each other for supremacy, Duke Huan and his long-time advisor Guan Zhong managed to transform Qi into China's most powerful polity. Duke Huan was eventually recognized by most of the Zhou states as well as the Zhou royal family as Hegemon of China. In this position, he fought off invasions of China by non-Zhou peoples and attempted to restore order throughout the lands. Toward the end of his more than forty-year-long reign, however, Duke Huan's power began to decline as he grew ill and Qi came to be embroiled in factional strife. Following his death in 643 BC, Qi completely lost its predominance.\n\nEarly life and rise to power \nXi\u01ceob\u00e1i was born as one of Duke Xi of Qi's sons, though not in line of succession for the throne as he had at least two older brothers: Zhu'er and Jiu. In his youth, Xi\u01ceob\u00e1i was tutored by Bao Shuya. When Duke Xi eventually died, Zhu'er became Qi's next ruler as \"Duke Xiang\" but his reign was fraught with internal conflicts and scandals. Recognizing this and fearing for his pupil's life, Bao Shuya took Xi\u01ceob\u00e1i and fled with him to the state of Ju where they went on to live in exile.\n\nDuke Xiang was assassinated in 686 BC, which allowed his cousin, Wuzhi, to ascend the throne. After just one month in office, however, Wuzhi was also murdered. With these two dead, Xi\u01ceob\u00e1i returned to Qi with the goal of becoming the next duke. He faced opposition in the form of his older brother Jiu however. Prince Jiu, by then also in exile, managed to gain the support of several high-ranking officials in Qi, his tutor Guan Zhong and Duke Zhuang of Lu. Before Jiu could be installed as new duke of Qi, however, Xi\u01ceob\u00e1i managed to seize control of Qi's government as well as its army, and was crowned as \"Duke Huan of Qi\" in 685 BC. The army of Lu under Duke Zhuang promptly invaded in order to install Prince Jiu on the throne, but the invading force suffered a crushing defeat at Ganshi and had to retreat. Qi's army under Bao Shuya in turn invaded Lu, and demanded Jiu and his supporters be handed over. To appease Duke Huan, Duke Zhuang then executed the rogue prince and delivered Guan Zhong to Qi as a prisoner.\n\nReign\n\nRise to hegemon \nThough he was now secure on the throne, the question that remained for Duke Huan was what to do with Guan Zhong who had so prominently supported his rival brother. Bao Shuya asked his newly crowned ruler to not just spare Guan Zhong, but to even employ him as chief minister due to his great talents. Duke Huan followed this advice, and Guan Zhong became his most important and capable advisor. The two went on to reorganize Qi's government and society, dividing both the land as well as the people into regulated units and enforcing a meritocratic system of governance. This greatly strengthened Qi, as it allowed the state to \"mobilize human and material resources more effectively than other Zhou states, which remained loosely structured.\" As Qi had already been a powerful polity in a favorable strategic situation before, these reforms managed to bring Qi to \"an unprecedented status of leadership in the entire Zhou world\". Together, Duke Huan and Guan Zhong worked toward achieving dominance over the other Zhou states, and as time went on ever more of them became followers of Qi.\n\nHegemony \nEventually Duke Huan invited the rulers of Lu, Song, Chen, and Zheng to a conference in 667 BC, where they elected him as their leader. After hearing of this, King Hui of Zhou appointed Duke Huan hegemon (ba) with the authority to operate militarily in the name of the royal court. Duke Huan and Guan Zhong envisioned the office of \"hegemon\" not just as mere position of military power, but rather as one that was supposed to \"restore the authority of the Son of Heaven\" or, more practically, restabilize the old realm of the Zhou dynasty under the leadership of Qi.\n\nConsequently, Duke Huan intervened in matters that concerned the interstate relationships of the Zhou polities, both on behalf of King Hui as well as to assert his own position as hegemon. Such interventions included a punitive expedition against Wey in 671 BC, because this state had defied King Hui, as well as involvement in a power struggle in Lu in order to cement Qi's power. Another major concern for Duke Huan was the threat that outside powers (derogatorily called the \"Four Barbarians\") posed to the Zhou states, and he would launch numerous campaigns to fend off these \"barbarians\". Most notably, he saved the states of Yan, Xing and Wey from invasions by non-Zhou groups, and tried to stop the expansion of Chu in the south. In 656 BC he led an alliance of eight states against a satellite state of Chu, Cai, and defeated it. The alliance then proceeded to invade Chu itself, and eventually a pact was concluded. Chu stopped its northward expansion and agreed to take part in an compulsory interstate meeting at Shaoling. This meeting, the first of its kind, set a precedent.\n\nOver the following years, Duke Huan convened numerous interstate meetings under the auspices of the Zhou royal family. Points of discussion during these meetings ranged from military matters to economics to general orders concerning governance and laws. Overall, the ruler of Qi managed to restore some stability in the volatile and fractious Zhou realm. Historian Cho-yun Hsu summarizes that Duke Huan \"used his Ba [hegemon] leadership to set up a new order for an interstate community that was to be guarded by consensus rather than authority.\"\n\nDecline in power and death \n\nAfter almost forty years on the throne, however, Duke Huan's dominance began to gradually decline. His efforts to completely stop Chu's expansion failed, as the southern state had simply shifted its attention from the north to the east. There, along the Huai River, Chu conquered or invaded several states allied with Qi. The last major anti-Chu military alliance assembled by Duke Huan failed to stop this development, and was even defeated during the Battle of Loulin in 645 BC. Guan Zhong also died in that year, depriving the ruler of Qi of his most important advisor. Having grown ill, Duke Huan was increasingly ignored by the leaders of other states, and even his authority over Qi itself declined as various political factions began to vie for power.\n\nThese factions were formed by high officials as well as six of the duke's sons. These six, namely Zhao, Wukui, Pan, Shangren, Yuan, and Yong, were all the children of different concubines, as Duke Huan's three main wives bore him no sons. As a result, all of them felt themselves entitled to the throne. Though Qi's ruler had designated Prince Zhao as his heir and even charged Duke Xiang of Song with ensuring that he would ascend the throne, this did not stop the other five from plotting their own rise to power. According to the Guanzi, the elderly duke had also to deal with four powerful officials: Tang Wu, the court sorcerer; Yiya, the chief cook; Shu Diao, the chief of the eunuchs; and Gongzi Kaifang, a leading courtier. Shortly before his death, Guan Zhong had advised that they should be sent into exile. Duke Huan did so, but he found himself missing their particular talents at the court and allowed them to return. They then conspired against him, and locked him in his room, secretly starving him to death. Other notable sources for these events, such as the Zuo Zhuan and the Records of the Grand Historian do not mention this purported assassination.\n\nDuke Huan of Qi finally died in late 643 BC, and the capital Linzi quickly descended into violence. His six sons, supported by various officials, took up arms against each other in order to size the throne, starting a war of succession. In this chaos, Duke Huan could not be buried and his corpse was left unattended in his bedchamber for between seven days and three months. By the time he was finally encoffined, the corpse had begun to rot. With Duke Huan's sons fighting for the throne, Qi was severely weakened and lost its status as China's predominant state. Although Zhao, by then ruling as Duke Xiao of Qi, eventually attempted to regain his father's hegemony, he failed and Duke Wen of Jin became the next hegemon.\n\nFamily\nWives:\n Wang Ji, of the Ji clan of Zhou (), a princess of Zhou by birth\n Xu Ying, of the Ying clan of Xu ()\n Cai Ji, of the Ji clan of Cai ()\n\nConcubines:\n Wey Gong Ji, of the Ji clan of Wey (), the mother of Prince Wukui\n Shao Wey Ji, of the Ji clan of Wey (), the mother of Prince Yuan\n Zheng Ji, of the Ji clan of Zheng (), the mother of Crown Prince Zhao\n Ge Ying, of the Ying clan of Ge (), the mother of Prince Pan\n Mi Ji, of the Ji clan of Mi (), the mother of Prince Shangren\n Song Hua Zi, of the Zi clan of Song (), the mother of Prince Yong\n\nSons:\n Prince Wukui (; d. 642 BC), ruled as the Duke of Qi in 642 BC\n Prince Yuan (; d. 599 BC), ruled as Duke Hui of Qi from 608\u2013599 BC\n Crown Prince Zhao (; d. 633 BC), ruled as Duke Xiao of Qi from 641\u2013633 BC\n Prince Pan (; d. 613 BC), ruled as Duke Zhao of Qi from 632\u2013613 BC\n Prince Shangren (; d. 609 BC), ruled as Duke Y\u00ec of Qi from 612\u2013609 BC\n Prince Yong ()\n Granted the fiefdom of Gu () in 634 BC\n Seven sons who served as Grand Masters () of Chu\n\nDaughters:\n Qi Jiang ()\n Married Duke Wu of Jin (d. 677 BC)\n Married Duke Xian of Jin (d. 651 BC), and had issue (Crown Prince Shensheng, Mu Ji (the wife of Duke Mu of Qin and mother of Duke Kang of Qin))\n\nAncestry\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography \n\nMonarchs of Qi (state)\n643 BC deaths\n7th-century BC Chinese monarchs\nDeaths by starvation\nYear of birth unknown", "machine_text": " Duke Huan of Qi (\u9f50\u6853\u516c) (685 BC \u2013 643 BC) was a powerful ruler of the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. He was known for his military conquests and strategic alliances, which greatly expanded the power and influence of Qi.\n\nEarly Life and Reign\n\nDuke Huan was born in 685 BC, the son of Duke Zhao of Qi. He ascended to the throne in 667 BC, upon the death of his father. At the time, Qi was a minor state surrounded by stronger neighbors, such as Jin, Yan, and Chu. Duke Huan was determined to strengthen his state and protect it from its rivals.\n\nMilitary Campaigns\n\nDuke Huan's reign was marked by a series of military campaigns against neighboring states. In 664 BC, he launched a successful attack against the State of Lu, capturing its capital city and forcing its ruler, Duke Min, to flee. He then turned his attention to the State of Jin, which was then the most powerful state in China. In 659 BC, Duke Huan defeated Jin's army in a battle near the Yellow River, and then captured the city of Jiang.\n\nStrategic Alliances\n\nIn addition to his military campaigns, Duke Huan also pursued strategic alliances with other states. In 661 BC, he formed an alliance with the State of Chu, which was then emerging as a major power in the south. This alliance was cemented through the marriage of Duke Huan's daughter to the King of Chu.\n\nAdministrative Reforms\n\nDuke Huan also implemented a number of administrative reforms in Qi. He established a centralized government, with a powerful prime minister and a network of officials who oversaw the state's affairs. He also created a system of laws and regulations that governed the behavior of Qi's citizens.\n\nCultural Achievements\n\nDuke Huan's reign was also notable for its cultural achievements. He patronized the arts and literature, and his court was known for its poets and scholars. He also encouraged the development of agriculture and trade, and his policies led to the growth of cities and the prosperity of Qi's people.\n\nLegacy\n\nDuke Huan's reign lasted for 25 years, until his death in 643 BC. He was succeeded by his son, Duke Xiang, who continued his father's policies and expanded Qi's power even further. Duke Huan is remembered as one of the greatest rulers in Chinese history, known for his military prowess, strategic thinking, and administrative reforms. His legacy continued to influence the development of Chinese civilization for centuries to come.\n\nConclusion\n\nDuke Huan of Qi was a powerful and influential ruler who played a significant role in the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. His military campaigns, strategic alliances, administrative reforms, and cultural achievements strengthened Qi and established it as a major power in the region. His legacy continued to influence Chinese civilization for centuries, and he remains an important figure in Chinese history.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1444284}

While the station has a waiting room, it is only open in early mornings and late evenings, half an hour before the first westbound and eastbound train arrives. It does not have a ticket agent, but the station does have personnel that can assist riders upon departure and arrival. The station is directly across the tracks from the National New York Central Railroad Museum.\n\nHistory \nElkhart station was originally built in 1900 by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and had a freight house installed across the tracks in 1907. The building is constructed of red brick trimmed with limestone, which is used for the window surrounds and belt course. The station was originally set amid a well-kept garden that displayed neat beds of colorful flowers and a row of trees along the tracks; this manicured landscape was not only a pretty introduction to the city for first time visitors, but it also buffered the streets of downtown from the noise and dirt associated with steam engines and freight trains. The station and the railroad were acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1914. NYC merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, and passenger service was taken over by Amtrak in 1971. The freight house became the National NYC Museum in 1987.\n\nTransit connections \n\nMACOG Interurban Trolley's Elkhart-Goshen and Concord routes both stop near the station. However, because of the way the train schedules are currently set up, riders can only connect to westbound trains.

The station serves as a vital transportation hub for the city and its surrounding areas, providing access to various parts of the Midwest. The station has a rich history, dating back to the late 19th century, and has undergone significant transformations over the years to accommodate the growing needs of the region.\n\nEarly Years\n\nThe Elkhart Station was first established in 1870, with the construction of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. The station was built on the west side of Elkhart, near the banks of the St. Joseph River. The location was chosen for its proximity to the river, which provided a means of transporting goods and people between Elkhart and other cities along the river. The station quickly became a vital transportation hub, connecting Elkhart to major cities such as Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan.\n\nExpansion and Growth\n\nIn the early 20th century, the station underwent significant expansion to accommodate the growing demand for rail transportation. The station was rebuilt and expanded, with the addition of new tracks, platforms, and a larger station building. The new building was designed in the Beaux-Arts style, with a grand clock tower and ornate details. The station's expansion was largely due to the growth of the railroad industry and the increasing importance of Elkhart as a transportation hub.\n\nDecline and Rebirth\n\nLike many train stations across the United States, Elkhart Station experienced a decline in usage in the second half of the 20th century. The rise of automobile travel and the construction of highways led to a decrease in rail traffic, and the station fell into disrepair. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, there was a renewed interest in rail transportation, and efforts were made to restore and revitalize the station.\n\nIn 1992, the Elkhart County Historical Society began a campaign to restore the station. The society raised funds to repair and renovate the building, and worked to have the station listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The restoration efforts were successful, and the station was added to the National Register in 1993.\n\nModern Day\n\nToday, Elkhart Station is a thriving transportation hub, with daily Amtrak service connecting Elkhart to Chicago, Detroit, and other cities across the Midwest. The station has also become a popular destination for tourists, with its historic architecture and picturesque setting along the St. Joseph River. Visitors can explore the station's museum, which showcases the history of rail transportation in the region, or take a stroll along the riverfront walkway.\n\nThe station's significance extends beyond its role as a transportation hub. It has played an important role in the history of Elkhart and the surrounding region, serving as a gateway to the Midwest. The station has been the site of many significant events, including the arrival of presidents and other dignitaries.\n\nConclusion\n\nElkhart Station is a testament to the rich history of rail transportation in the Midwest. From its humble beginnings as a small depot to its current status as a thriving transportation hub, the station has played a vital role in connecting Elkhart and the surrounding region to the rest of the country. The station's restoration and preservation efforts have ensured that it will continue to serve as a gateway to the Midwest for generations to come.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 9974223}

It has also won the Thuringia Cup on three occasions and, through this, qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal, the German Cup.\n\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe football team FC Wacker 05 Nordhausen was founded on 1 November 1905 as an offshoot of a Protestant youth club in the city. By 14 June 1906 the team had broadened its scope to become the sports club SV Wacker 05 Nordhausen  and in 1908 merged with local side Ballsport-Club Mars Nordhausen which had been formed in 1906. Until 1918 the club played as SV Wacker-Mars Nordhausen when it was renamed 1. SV Wacker 05 Nordhausen. Playing in the VMBV (Verband Mitteldeutscher Ballspiel Vereine or Federation of Middle German Ball Playing Teams), Wacker participated in the early rounds of the league championships in the mid- to late 20s, but without any success.\n\nAfter the end of World War II occupying Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of all organizations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. The former membership of Wacker reorganized as SG Nordhausen in 1946 and this team went on to become the football department of the sports club BSG Motor Nordhausen in 1949. The club played briefly as KWU/Lok Nordhausen after a merger with an industrial club. From 1951 on the team played as BSG Motor Nordhausen-West in second tier East German football. Motor enjoyed some modest success in the early 80s but then slipped and was relegated to the third division Bezirkliga Erfurt in 1989.\n\nAfter German reunification in 1990 the football department separated from the sports club to form FSV Wacker 90. The newly independent team took up play in the NOFV-Oberliga S\u00fcd (III) in the 1991\u201392 season and played at that level for seven years, interrupted by three seasons in the Regionalliga Nordost (III) from 1995 to 1998. During the 1990s the club made three appearances in the DFB-Pokal, in 1992\u201393, 1996\u201397 and 1997\u201398 but was knocked out in the first round at each occasion. After relegation back to the NOFV-Oberliga S\u00fcd (IV) in 1998 the club slowly declined.  Financial problems drove the club further down to the Landesliga Th\u00fcringen (V) in 2000\u201301 before they finally landed in the Landesklasse Thuringen-Ost (VI) in 2002.\n\nAfter a decade of lower league play the club won the Th\u00fcringenliga in 2011\u201312 and the NOFV-Oberliga S\u00fcd the season after to make a return to the Regionalliga Nordost where it plays today.\n\nStadium\nFSV plays its home matches in the Albert-Kuntz-Sportpark which has a capacity of 8,000 (~1,000 seats) spectators.\n\nCurrent squad\n\nHonors\nThe club's honours:\n NOFV-Oberliga S\u00fcd\n Champions: 1995, 2013\n Th\u00fcringenliga\n Champions: 2012, 2015\u2021\n Landesklasse Th\u00fcringen-Ost\n Champions: 2005\n Thuringia Cup\n Winners: 1992, 1996, 1997, 2019\n Runners-up: 1998, 1999, 2017\n \u2021 Denotes won by reserve team.\n\nRecent seasons\nThe recent season-by-season performance of the club:\n\n With the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 and the 3.

His later years were devoted to the production of animated cartoons in Canada. After firing Shamus Culhane from the animator's supervising director job on Rocket Robin Hood, director Ralph Bakshi and background artist Johnnie Vita were brought to Toronto, not knowing that Krantz and producer Al Guest were in the middle of a lawsuit.\n\nFailing to reach a settlement with Guest, Krantz told Bakshi to grab the series' model sheets and return to the United States. When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi's arrest was issued by the Toronto police. Bakshi's animation studio, Bakshi Productions, took over Rocket Robin Hood and another Krantz-produced series, Spider-Man, beginning Krantz' working relationship with Bakshi.\n\nBy 1968, Krantz was producing live-action shows (such as the Canadian supernatural series Strange Paradise). Krantz agreed to produce Bakshi's animated film Heavy Traffic, but told Bakshi that Hollywood studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. Bakshi later pitched a film adaptation of Robert Crumb's comic strip Fritz the Cat, and Krantz sent Bakshi to San Francisco in an attempt to persuade Crumb to sign the contract. Krantz later acquired the film rights through Crumb's then-wife, Dana, who had Crumb's power of attorney and signed the contract. Fritz the Cat was released on April 12, 1972, opening in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. A major hit, it became the most successful independent animated feature of all time.\n\nTowards the end of the year, Krantz began coproducing Heavy Traffic with Samuel Z. Arkoff, but Krantz had not compensated Bakshi for his work on Fritz the Cat, and halfway through the production of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked when he would be paid. Krantz responded, \"The picture didn't make any money, Ralph. It's just a lot of noise.\" Bakshi found Krantz's claims dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Bakshi soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied. When Bakshi attempted to work with Albert S. Ruddy on another film, Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio and called several directors, including Chuck Jones, in search of a replacement. Arkoff threatened to withdraw his financial backing unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, which Krantz did a week later.\n\nAfter 1974, live-action motion pictures dominated Krantz' filmography. He wrote two novels, including Laurel Canyon (Pocket Books, 1979, paperback original), which was a best-seller.\n\nPersonal life\nKrantz married magazine writer Judith Tarcher on February 19, 1954. In the mid-1970s, as Judith Krantz, she began her career as a best-selling novelist. Judith's first book, Scruples, was published in 1978, and reached number one on the New York Times bestseller list.\nThe couple had two sons, Tony Krantz and Nicholas.

Records. The album was produced by Rick Rubin, marking the band's first album since ...And Justice for All (1988) not to be produced by longtime collaborator Bob Rock. It is also the first Metallica album to feature bassist Robert Trujillo, and the second to share writing credit to all of the band's members.\n\nMetallica began writing music for a new album in 2006, later recording the album at different studios across Los Angeles County, California, from March 2007 to May 2008. Musically, Death Magnetic is a radical departure from Metallica's previous album, St. Anger (2003), and is considered a return to the band's thrash metal roots, with more complex compositions, standard guitar tuning on most songs and long guitar solos from Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield. It also includes the band's first instrumental piece, \"Suicide & Redemption\", since \"To Live Is to Die\" from ...And Justice for All.\n\nDeath Magnetic made Metallica the first band to achieve five consecutive number-one studio albums on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album received positive reviews, but its production was criticized as overcompressed and cited as a product of the loudness war. The album and its songs were nominated for six Grammy Awards (five in 2009 and one in 2010) and won three, including Best Metal Performance for \"My Apocalypse\". In support of the album, Metallica embarked on the World Magnetic Tour from October 2008 to November 2010. Four unreleased tracks from the album's recording sessions were later released as the Beyond Magnetic EP in December 2011.\n\nProduction\n\nWriting\n\nEarly in 2004, lead singer James Hetfield revealed that Metallica had been playing new material during studio sessions, but that there was no mention of plans for a ninth studio album at that time. Select music from the jam sessions may be used on the album, as Lars Ulrich stated, \"I definitely look forward to sifting through some of that stuff when we get back to the studio in January.\" On that note, by October 2004, the band had already compiled nearly 50 hours of pre-set jamming, with hundreds of riffs, chord progressions and bass lines. On September 30, 2004, Launch Radio revealed from an interview with Hetfield that the band hoped to return to the studio in spring of 2005 to begin recording their ninth studio album for Warner Bros. Records.\n\nOn March 10, 2006, it was reported that Metallica was planning to use the following six months to write material for the album, in addition to the previous two months they had already been spending writing music. Ulrich also stated that the band was getting along much better in the studio than they did during the recording of St. Anger. On April 6, he revealed that the band had composed \"six to seven\" songs (except for vocals) from their findings off the riff tapes recording during pre-sets of the Madly in Anger with the World Tour. He also said that by this point, the band's new material was reminiscent of \"old school\" Metallica works, and that it certainly did not feel like a St. Anger \"part two\".\n\nOn May 20, 2006, Kirk Hammett revealed that the band had fifteen songs written and were writing on average two to three songs per week. Hetfield also praised producer Rick Rubin for his production style in giving the band their own freedom and keeping the pressure at a minimum, despite the sessions becoming sometimes briefly unfocused. On May 27, Metallica updated their website with a video featuring information regarding the album.\n\nRecording\n\nThree studios were used to produce the album, those being Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, Shangri La Studios in Malibu, California, and HQ in San Rafael, California. On January 1, 2007, Ulrich stated in an interview with Revolver that the band would be conceiving the album much like they did their albums prior to working with ex-producer Bob Rock; they would sit down, write a select number of songs, then enter the studio to record them. He also quoted Rubin by saying \"Rubin didn't want them to start the recording process until every song that they were going to record was as close to 100 percent as possible.\"\n\nOn March 5, Ulrich revealed that the band had narrowed a potential 25 songs down to 14, and that they would begin recording those fourteen on the following week. He also expanded on Rubin's style of production, saying,\n\nOn March 14, the band's official website issued a statement: \"Metallica left the comfort of HQ this week to descend upon the greater Los Angeles area to begin recording their ninth original album. This is the first time they've recorded outside of the Bay Area since they spent time at One-on-One Studios recording their self-titled album in 1990 and '91.\" This was confirmed on July 24, 2008, on Mission: Metallica, as a video surfaced showing the crew moving into Sound City Studios of Nirvana fame.\n\nOn June 4, Robert Trujillo revealed that only select portions of the two new songs debuted in Berlin and Tokyo respectively would be featured on the album. The band hoped to have the album finished by October or November, when the album would be mixed. He predicted the album would be out in February 2008, and revealed that the songs they were working with were quite long.\n\nOn February 2, 2008, Sterlingsound.com revealed that Ted Jensen from Sterling Sound Studios would be mastering the new record. According to Blabbermouth.net and other sources, Greg Fidelman, who had served as a sound engineer, had also been tapped to mix the album.\n\nUlrich confirmed on May 15, 2008, that Metallica recorded eleven songs for Death Magnetic, although only ten would appear on the album due to the constraints of the physical medium. The eleventh song, titled \"Shine\" (which was later retitled \"Just a Bullet Away\"), was a song Hetfield \"based around a Layne Staley type, a rock & roll martyr magnetized by death.\"\n\nUnreleased tracks\n\nA number of unreleased songs from Death Magnetic, including the above-mentioned \"Just a Bullet Away\", but also \"Hell and Back\", \"Hate Train\" and \"Rebel of Babylon\" were left off the album, but were rumored to be released as B-sides or on the next album. The titles were confirmed by Hammett and Ulrich on the MetOnTour video from December 20, 2008. On December 5, 7, 9 and 10, 2011, the band played four new songs, \"Hate Train\", \"Just a Bullet Away\", \"Hell and Back\" and \"Rebel of Babylon\", at the band's 30th Anniversary concerts. The day after each concert, MetClub members were sent an e-mail with a code for a free download of a rough mix of the song played at the show. The songs were released officially on the Beyond Magnetic EP, released on December 13, 2011. Two other songs recorded during Death Magnetic, based on \"The New Song\" (performed in 2006) and \"The Other New Song\" (performed in 2006 and 2007), have not been released, though parts of \"The New Song\" can be found in the recorded songs \"The End of the Line\" and \"All Nightmare Long\".\n\nTitle\nKirk Hammett played a role in inspiring the album title by bringing a photograph of deceased Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley to the studio where Metallica was recording. \"That picture was there for a long time\", said Hammett, \"I think it pervaded James' psyche.\" Wondering why someone with Staley's talent would choose to use drugs so heavily and die so young, Hetfield started writing a song based on his questions (the song \"Rebel of Babylon\").\n\nOn July 16, 2008, Hetfield commented on the album's title:\n\nThe title is referenced in the track \"My Apocalypse\". According to Hammett, another title considered for the album was Songs of Suicide and Forgiveness. Death Magnetic was eventually picked out of four working titles when Hetfield met with creative agency Turner Duckworth, who were brought to deal with the album's visual identity, and as he discussed the songs \"it was clear that they were all linked to death, facing up to the nature of death, and the fear and attraction that surrounds death.\"\n\nRelease and promotion\n\nIn January 2008, a statement was made by Stereo Warning that the album would be delayed until September 2008, The album, which was completed on August 10, 2008, was released on September 12 in the United States and issued in a variety of different packages.\n\nOn September 2, a French record store began selling copies of Death Magnetic, nearly two weeks ahead of its scheduled worldwide release date, which resulted in the album being made prematurely available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor, Vertigo Records, to officially release the album two days ahead of schedule, on September 12. Ulrich, who was questioned about the leak on a San Francisco radio station, responded,\n\nHe later told USA Today,\n\nDuring their Escape from the Studio '06 tour, Metallica debuted two songs. \"The New Song\" debuted on the European leg in Berlin, Germany on June 6, 2006. The song, as performed, is approximately eight minutes long. The title was rumored to be \"Death Is Not the End\" as Hetfield repeatedly sings the line throughout the song. This song would appear again in multiple Fly on the Wall videos on the Mission: Metallica website, showing the band partway through the song's recording, as noted by the slower tempo and lack of lyrics. \"The Other New Song\", (which was later named \"Vulturous\") debuted on August 12, 2006, in Tokyo, and is much shorter, taking just below four minutes to perform. To the surprise of fans, Metallica played \"The Other New Song\" once again on June 29, 2007, in Bilbao, Spain. Although neither of the \"New Songs\" appear on the album themselves, \"The End of the Line\" and \"All Nightmare Long\" both contain elements of \"The New Song\".\n\nOn August 9, 2008, Metallica debuted the first album track, \"Cyanide\", at Ozzfest, in Dallas, Texas and was performed again on August 20, 2008, in Dublin, Ireland. On August 22, at the Leeds Festival, they debuted the first single, \"The Day That Never Comes\".\n\nOn July 31, 2009, it was announced on Metallica.com that the band felt that the song \"My Apocalypse\" was in need of an introduction when played live to \"set the mood\". The statement on Metallica.com reads, \"We've been enjoying playing 'My Apocalypse' out here on the road but felt like it could use something extra. We decided that it needed a cool intro to set the mood so James wrote one. Check out and enjoy this free download\u00a0... and make sure you learn it for singing along at a future show!\" The approximately minute-long introduction is available as a free MP3 download. The song had originally been debuted live on March 25, 2009, at the LG Arena in Birmingham, UK.\n\nOn the day of the release FMQB radio broadcast The World Premiere of Death Magnetic, which was heard on more than 175 stations across the US and Canada. The live program from Metallica HQ featured all four members of Metallica talking with Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl and drummer Taylor Hawkins. Originally scheduled for a 90-minute broadcast, the show ended after two hours.\n\nPackaging and versions\nUlrich brought the agency Turner Duckworth, co-owned by his personal friend David Turner, as he wanted someone that \"would bring fresh ideas\", and commanded respect in branding but were not jaded by the music business\". While Turner and his partner Bruce Duckworth played with the two elements from the title, they emerged with the cover that combined a white coffin, a grave, and a magnetic field, depicted by a model made and photographed by Andy Grimshaw. Turner added the image was \"simple and literal but at the same time open to all sorts of interpretations\", saying that Hetfield considered the coffin shaped as \"a door, to another experience, or consciousness\". Duckworth stated that the cover fit their intention of something that would also be recognizable in a digital format, \"small icons that go on your phone or iPod\".\n\nTurner compared the Metallica project with a campaign they did for Coca-Cola, as both approaches went down to \"stripping things back down to what the brand was originally and the other part was adding a fresh new approach.\" The original Metallica logo was brought back to demonstrate how the band was trying to restore their old identity, while the cover was primarily white to contrast how the color is hardly used in the metal genre. Given the band wanted the physical release to be memorable to ensure it still had value in an age where audiences were purchasing more digital music, the original digipak featuring a layered die cut, where each page of the booklet resembled a layer of dirt being thrown on the coffin. Death Magnetic was issued on vinyl in a special box set, and also had a deluxe edition shaped like a coffin, bundled along with an additional disc full of demos, a making-of DVD, an exclusive T-shirt, guitar picks, a flag and a fold-out poster.\n\nGuitar Hero\nAlongside the release of the album, it was released as downloadable content (DLC) for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. This content would later be optimized for external use in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica (although \"All Nightmare Long\" was included on the in-game setlist), Guitar Hero 5, Band Hero, and Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock.\n\nThe Guitar Hero DLC had two versions of the instrumental track \"Suicide & Redemption\". The versions differed by the guitar solo performed on the song: one version had a solo performed by Hetfield, the other a solo by Hammett. The tracks were titled according to the solo they contained, with the Hetfield version named \"Suicide & Redemption J.H.\" and the Hammett version named \"Suicide & Redemption K.H.\"\n\nDue to technical restrictions, the Wii version of Guitar Hero: World Tour only could hold the three shortest songs of the eleven: \"Broken, Beat & Scarred\", \"Cyanide\" and \"My Apocalypse\". These songs also appear on the Wii and PS2 versions of Guitar Hero: Metallica as bonus songs instead of DLC. The eight remaining tracks (including both versions of \"Suicide & Redemption\") were released on November 24, 2009, as DLC for Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero for Wii.\n\nTour\n\nMetallica promoted Death Magnetic with the World Magnetic Tour, which started on October 21, 2008, in Phoenix, Arizona. The North American leg finished in February 2009 and was followed by European concerts, interrupted only by a surprise gig at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas to promote the video game Guitar Hero: Metallica. A second North American leg, prioritizing markets missed by the original concerts, began in September. The tour returned to both continents while also extending to Latin America, Israel, Japan and Oceania in 2010, ending on November 21 in Melbourne, Australia. The 2010 Sonisphere Festival headlined by Metallica had them for the first time accompanied by the rest of the \"Big Four of thrash metal\", Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax, and the concert where all bands played together for one song was released theatrically and on home video as The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria. Metallica also released in November 2009 two video albums out of World Magnetic Tour performances that year, Orgullo, Pasi\u00f3n, y Gloria: Tres Noches en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico featuring three Mexico City concerts in June, and Fran\u00e7ais Pour une Nuit with a concert in the French town of N\u00eemes in July.\n\nReception\n\nIn a 2007 interview with Rolling Stone, ex-Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum described his impressions of the unfinished songs:\n\nThe album's first single, \"The Day That Never Comes\", was described by BBC Music as the closest thing to a ballad on the album. Rock Sound has also compared it to the likes of Thin Lizzy. The band has abandoned the solo-free approach that they followed on St. Anger, returning to complex, multi-layered arrangements such as those typically found on the band's fourth album ...And Justice for All.\n\nDeath Magnetic has been praised by fans as well as critics as a comeback for Metallica after the widely panned St. Anger. Thrash Hits was one of the first websites, along with The Quietus, to comment on Death Magnetic, claiming \"it is a vast improvement on 2003 album St Anger\". Metal Hammer noted Death Magnetics \"sharp riffs\" and \"uncharacteristic bouncing grooves\", and favorably compares the band's sound on the album to bands like Slayer, Led Zeppelin and Rage Against the Machine. Former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy has praised the album, saying \"Death Magnetic is hands down the best Metallica album in 20 years. This is the CD I've been waiting for them to make since ...And Justice for All. And thumbs up to them for doing the first real Metallica instrumental in 20 years since 'To Live Is to Die'. Welcome back, boys.\"\n\nWhile Metallica was on the first leg of their 2008 tour in Europe, a third party at their management Q Prime demanded that media impressions and blogs commenting on the album be taken down from their website for reasons that were not explained to the band. However, when the band learned of this, they were upset and Ulrich re-posted many of the links along with other reactions to the new album, along with an apology to those whose links had been removed from Metallica's website.\n\nReviews for the album have been mostly positive. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated the album was like \"hearing Metallica sound like Metallica again\". Other positive reviews come from publications like The Guardian, who say that the album is \"the strongest material the band have written in 20 years\", and Uncut, declaring that \"like all the best heavy rock albums, it suspends your disbelief, demands your attention and connects directly with your inner adolescent.\" BBC Music's Chris Jones felt that Hetfield's lyrics had become \"the channel of his post-therapy angst\". The Observer stated \"it's a joy to have these gnarled veterans back to reinforce the sheer visceral thrill of timeless heavy metal\".\n\nOn September 15, 2008, after a reviewer for Swedish daily Sydsvenskan admitted that he preferred a shortened mix of Death Magnetic to the official release, a scheduled interview was duly cancelled by Universal Music Sweden. Its president, Per Sundin said:\n\nCompression\n\nThe album has been criticized for having compromised sound quality, due to an excessively compressed dynamic range, leading to audible distortion. Sean Michaels of The Guardian explains that this is \"a result of the 'loudness war' \u2013 an ongoing industry effort to make recordings as loud as possible\". A Rolling Stone article states that Rubin was \"overseeing mixes in Los Angeles while the band is in Europe, headlining shows\" and only communicated with him by conference calls.\n\nFans have noted that these sonic problems are not present in the Guitar Hero version of the album, where the guitars, bass, drums, and vocals are presented separately due to the mechanics of the game. The tracks were sent to the game publishers prior to being compressed. As a result, fans have shared \"Guitar Hero\" versions of the album. MusicRadar and Rolling Stone attribute a quote to the album's mastering engineer Ted Jensen in which he claims that \"mixes were already brick-walled before they arrived\" for mastering and cite a petition from fans to remix or remaster the album.\n\nMetallica and Rubin initially declined to comment, while the band's co-manager Cliff Burnstein stated that complainers were in a minority and that response to the album had otherwise been \"overwhelmingly positive\". Ulrich later confirmed in an interview with Blender, that some creative control regarding the album's production had been transferred to Rubin but also stressed his satisfaction with the final product.\n\nIn 2015, the album was re-released on iTunes with a new \"Mastered for iTunes\" mastering which features an improved dynamic range and lack of distortion. Digital downloads from Metallica's official website all use the \"Mastered for iTunes\" version.\n\nAccolades\nDeath Magnetic and its songs were nominated for five Grammy Awards at the 51st Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009, including Best Rock Album and Best Rock Instrumental Performance for \"Suicide & Redemption\", winning Best Metal Performance for \"My Apocalypse\". Rick Rubin also received the award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical, and art directors Bruce Duckworth, David Turner & Sarah Moffat were awarded Best Recording Package. \"The Unforgiven III\" was also nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 52nd Grammy Awards. Death Magnetic was awarded Best Album in the 2009 Kerrang! Awards.\n\nAt the 2008 Metal Storm Awards, the album won Best Heavy Metal Album and Biggest Surprise.\n\nCommercial performance\nDeath Magnetic debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, selling 490,000 copies in just three days of availability. It is the band's fifth consecutive studio album to debut at #1, making Metallica the first band to have five consecutive studio album releases to do so. The album marked the highest first week sales for the group since 1996's Load.\n\nAccording to the September 27, 2008 issue of Billboard, Death Magnetic landed at #1 on the following ten charts: Billboard 200, Billboard Comprehensive Albums, Top Rock Albums, Top Hard Rock Albums, Top Modern Rock/Alternative Albums, Top Digital Albums, Top Internet Albums, Top European Albums, Tastemakers. \"The Day That Never Comes\" topped the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album stayed at #1 for three consecutive weeks on the Billboard 200, and spent 50 consecutive weeks on said chart.

The album debuted at #1 on the UK albums chart after three days of availability, selling 75,164 copies. It remained at #1 for two weeks and has sold over 150,000 copies to date. In Canada, Death Magnetic debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart. It sold 81,000 copies in its first week, making it the second best-selling debut album of 2008 in Canada. It remained the #1 album for four consecutive weeks. The album was certified 4x platinum in Canada in October 2009.\n\nIn Australia, Death Magnetic was the fastest selling album of 2008, selling 55,877 copies in its first full week of release. Death Magnetic was Australia's highest-selling record in one week since Australian Idol winner Damien Leith's The Winner's Journey, in December 2006. The same success was repeated in Germany, where Death Magnetic has become the fastest selling album of 2008. Within the first three days of the album's release, Death Magnetic sold over 100,000 copies and has been certified platinum. According to reports, Death Magnetic is outselling competitors in Russia and Turkey, two countries which do not have an official album chart.\n\nIn Finland, during the second week of January 2009, Death Magnetic jumped eighteen spots back up to #1 on that country's album charts within one week.\n\nDeath Magnetic was certified 2x platinum (two million units sold) by the RIAA on June 28, 2010.\n\nTrack listing\n\nDeluxe edition\nThe deluxe edition of the album included a bonus CD titled Demo Magnetic, which consisted of demo versions of the tracks on the album with working titles, and a bonus DVD depicting the making of the album.\n\nFormats\nExperience 2\nA physical copy of the Death Magnetic CD.\n\nExperience 4\nA box set of Death Magnetic on five 180-gram vinyl LP records, with five individual sleeves and a Mission: Metallica lithograph.

It was the band's first album to be produced by Rick Rubin, who had previously worked with the band on their hit single \"Enter Sandman\" in 1991. The album marked a return to Metallica's heavy metal roots, after the more experimental and controversial albums of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe album was recorded at Rubin's home studio in Los Angeles, and was the band's first album to feature bassist Robert Trujillo, who had joined the band in 2003. The album was also the first to feature guitarist Kirk Hammett's side project, the KH Riff Raff, which contributed to the album's more aggressive and heavy sound.\n\nThe album's lyrics dealt with themes of death, war, and the supernatural, with songs such as \"The End of the Line\" and \"All Nightmare Long\" exploring the idea of mortality and the afterlife. The album's lead single, \"Hardwired\", was released on August 18, 2008, and was well received by fans and critics alike, with its fast-paced tempo and aggressive riffs.\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews upon its release, with many critics praising the band's return to their heavy metal roots. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling over 490,000 copies in its first week of release. It also reached the top of the charts in several other countries, including Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe album's production was also praised, with Rubin's minimalist approach allowing the band's raw sound to shine through. The album's mixing was done by Ted Jensen, who had previously worked with the band on their album \"Garage Inc.\" in 1998.\n\nDeath Magnetic was supported by a number of music videos, including \"Hardwired\", \"The Day That Never Comes\", and \"Cyanide\". The album's release was also accompanied by a number of live performances, including a concert at the Apollo Theater in New York City, which was broadcast live on MTV.\n\nThe album's success was not without controversy, however, as some fans criticized the album's production quality, citing problems with the mix and mastering. In response, the band released a statement defending the album's sound, and Rubin later revealed that the album had been mixed and mastered using analog equipment, rather than digital, in order to create a warmer, more natural sound.\n\nOverall, Death Magnetic was a critical and commercial success for Metallica, and marked a return to form for the band after a period of experimentation and change. It remains a fan favorite and a staple of the band's live shows to this day.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 9224690}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hansard\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Hansard is the traditional name of the transcripts of Parliamentary debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. It is named after Thomas Curson Hansard (1776\u20131833), a London printer and publisher, who was the first official printer to the Parliament at Westminster.\n\nOrigins\nThough the history of the Hansard began in the British parliament, each of Britain's colonies developed a separate and distinctive history. Before 1771, the British Parliament had long been a highly secretive body. The official record of the actions of the House was publicly available, but there was no record of the debates. The publication of remarks made in the House became a breach of Parliamentary privilege, punishable by the two Houses of Parliament. As the populace became interested in parliamentary debates, more independent newspapers began publishing unofficial accounts of them.\n\nThe many penalties implemented by the government, including fines, dismissal, imprisonment, and investigations, are reflective of \"the difficulties faced by independent newspapermen who took an interest in the development of Upper Canada, and who, in varying degrees, attempted to educate the populace to the shortcomings of their rulers\".\n\nSeveral editors used the device of veiling parliamentary debates as debates of fictitious societies or bodies. The names under which parliamentary debates were published include Proceedings of the Lower Room of the Robin Hood Society and Debates of the Senate of Magna Lilliputia. The Senate of Magna Lilliputia was printed in Edward Cave's The Gentleman's Magazine, which was first published in 1732. The names of the speakers were carefully \"filleted\"; for example, Sir Robert Walpole was thinly disguised as \"Sr. R\u2015t W\u2015le\".\n\nIn 1771 Brass Crosby, who was Lord Mayor of the City of London, had brought before him a printer by the name of John Miller who dared publish reports of Parliamentary proceedings. He released the man, but was subsequently ordered to appear before the House to explain his actions. Crosby was committed to the Tower of London, but when he was brought to trial, several judges refused to hear the case and after protests from the public, Crosby was released. Parliament ceased to punish the publishing of its debates as harshly, partly due to the campaigns of John Wilkes on behalf of free speech. There then began several attempts to publish reports of debates. Among the early successes, the Parliamentary Register published by John Almon and John Debrett began in 1775 and ran until 1813.\n\nWilliam Cobbett (1763\u20131835), a noted radical and publisher, began publishing Parliamentary Debates as a supplement to his Political Register in 1802, eventually extending his reach back with the Parliamentary History. Cobbett's avocation for the freedom of the press was severely punished by the British Government. On 5 June 1810 William Cobbett stood trial for seditious libel for an article he wrote against the British Government which was published by Thomas Curson Hansard. Cobbett was found \"guilty, upon the fullest and most satisfactory evidence\". The court sentence read: \"The court do adjudge that you, William Cobbett pay to our Lord the King a fine of \u00a31000; that you be imprisoned in His Majesty's gaol of Newgate for the space of two years, and that at expiration of that time you enter into a recognizance to keep the peace for seven years\u2014yourself in the sum of \u00a33000, and two good and sufficient sureties in the sum of \u00a31000; and further, that you be imprisoned till that recognizance be entered into, and that fine paid\". The sentence was described by J. C. Trewin as \"vindictive\". The Court argued that Thomas Curson Hansard, who had \"seen the copy before it was printed, ought not to have suffered it to have been printed at all\" and was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the King's Bench Prison.\n\nCobbett's reports were printed by Thomas Curson Hansard from 1809; in 1812, Cobbett's finances ran asunder and he divested himself of his proprietorship of both the Parliamentary Debates and Parliamentary History, which then \"passed into the hands of Hansard in 1812\". Cobbett's Parliamentary Debates became Hansard Parliamentary Debates, \"abbreviated over time to the now familiar Hansard\". From 1829 the name \"Hansard\" appeared on the title page of each issue. Neither Cobbett nor Hansard ever employed anyone to take down notes of the debates, which were taken from a multiplicity of sources in the morning newspapers. For this reason, early editions of Hansard are not to be absolutely relied upon as a guide to everything discussed in Parliament.\n\nHansard outlasted competitors including Almon and Debrett, and the later Mirror of Parliament published by J. H. Barrow from 1828 to 1843; Barrow's work was more comprehensive but he checked each speech with the Member and allowed them to \"correct\" anything they wished they had not said. The last attempt at a commercial rival was The Times which published debates in the 1880s. In 1878 a subsidy was granted to the Hansard press and at that point reporters were employed. Despite hiring contract reporters there were still widespread complaints about the accuracy of the debate reports. In 1889 Henry Hansard, the son of Thomas Hansard, broke the family connection with the debates.\n\nIn the United Kingdom\nThe Hansard of today, a comprehensive account of every speech, began in 1909 when Parliament took over the publication and established its own staff of official Hansard reporters. At the same time the decision was made to publish debates of the two houses in separate volumes, and to change the front cover from orange-red to light blue. A larger page format was introduced with new technology in 1980.\n\nHansard is not a word-for-word transcript of debates in Parliament. Its terms of reference are those set by a House of Commons select committee in 1893, as being a report which, though not strictly verbatim, is substantially the verbatim report with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes (including grammatical mistakes) corrected, but which, on the other hand, leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument.\n\nOne instance of such an eliminated redundancy involves the calling of MPs to speak in the House of Commons. In that house, the Speaker must call on an MP by name before that member may speak, but Hansard makes no mention of the recognition accorded by the Speaker. Also, Hansard sometimes adds extraneous material to make the remarks less ambiguous. For example, though members refer to each other as \"the hon. Member for Constituency Name rather than by name, Hansard adds, in parentheses, the name of the MP being referred to, the first time that MP is referred to in a speech or debate. When an MP simply points at another whose constituency he or she cannot remember, Hansard identifies him or her.\n\nAny interruption to debate will be marked with the word \"(Interruption)\". This understated phrase covers a variety of situations, ranging from members laughing uproariously to the physical invasion of the chamber. Interjections from seated members, such as heckling during Prime Minister's Questions, are generally only included if the member who is speaking responds to the interjection.\n\nHansard also publishes written answers \u2013 known as written ministerial statements \u2013 made by government ministers in response to questions formally posed by members. In 1839, Hansard, by order of the House of Commons, printed and published a report stating that an indecent book published by a Mr. Stockdale was circulating in Newgate Prison. Stockdale sued for defamation but Hansard's defence, that the statement was true, succeeded. On publication of a reprint, Stockdale sued again but Hansard was ordered by the House to plead that he had acted under order of the Commons and was protected by parliamentary privilege. In the resulting case of Stockdale v Hansard, the court found that the house held no privilege to order publication of defamatory material. In consequence, Parliament passed the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 to establish privilege for publications under the house's authority.\n\nSince 1909\u2014and for important votes before then\u2014Hansard has listed how members have voted in divisions. Furthermore, the proceedings and debates in committee are also published in separate volumes. For many years the House of Commons Hansard did not formally acknowledge the existence of parties in the House, except obliquely, with MPs' references to other MPs of the same party as \"hon. Friends\", but in 2003 this changed and members' party affiliations are now identified. The Hansard of the House of Lords operates entirely independently of its Commons counterpart, but with similar terms of reference. It covers parliamentary business in the House of Lords chamber itself, as well as the debates in the Moses Room, known as Grand Committee. Parliamentary written answers and statements are also printed. Emma Crewe notes that \"Editors view reporters in general as a hive of revolution and anti-establishment attitudes, while they perceive themselves as calm and uncomplaining\". The Internet, with the help of volunteers, has made the UK Hansard more accessible. The UK Hansard is currently being digitised to a high-level format for on-line publication. It is possible to review and search the UK Hansard from 1803, with the exception of standing committees.\n\nBecause Hansard is treated as accurate, there is a parliamentary convention whereby if a member of Parliament makes an inaccurate statement in Parliament, they must write a correction in the copy of Hansard kept in the House of Commons library.\n\nIn 2010 historic copies of Hansard were sent to India in its original volume format and was transformed from the original bound versions into plain text by optical character recognition (OCR) and put on the Internet to enable easy research. In July 2018 this digitised Hansard was vastly improved and merged with the rest of Hansard as previously it was available under two websites and now it is a single website. There are still many 'typos' from the OCR process but readers are encouraged to report them when they are spotted.\n\nCanada\n\nHouse of Commons\nAs with the Westminster Hansard, the Canadian version is not strictly verbatim, and is guided by the principle of avoiding \"repetitions, redundancies and obvious errors\". Unlike the UK House of Commons, members are referred to in the House only by the parliamentary ridings they represent (\"The member for Richmond Hill\", etc.) or by their cabinet post. Hansard supplies an affiliation the first time each member speaks in the House on a particular day\u2014\"Mr. Mathieu Ravignat (Pontiac, NDP)\" or \"Hon. Lynne Yelich (Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification, CPC)\"\u2014and by name only when they rise later to speak.\n\nIf interjections give rise to a call for order by the Speaker, they are reported as \"Some hon. members: Oh, oh!\" The details of the approval or negativing of motions and bills are reported in rather baroque detail:\n\nTranslation\nGiven the bilingual nature of the Canadian federal government, two equivalent Canadian Hansards are maintained, one in French and one in English. This makes it a natural parallel text, and it is often used to train French\u2013English machine translation programs. In addition to being already translated and aligned, the size of the Hansards and the fact that new material is always being added makes it an attractive corpus. However, its usefulness is hindered by the fact that the translations, although accurate in meaning, are not always literally exact.\n\nThe Canadian Hansard records make note of the language used by the members of parliament, so as not to misinterpret the words of the person who has the floor. If the member speaks in French, the English Hansard records would state that the member spoke in French and refer the reader to the French Hansard record.\n\nIn one instance, during a Liberal filibuster in the Senate of Canada, Senator Philippe Gigant\u00e8s was accused of reading one of his books only so that he could get the translation for free through the Hansard.\n\nNewfoundland\nIn Newfoundland the struggle for the free press was much more violent. Henry Winton, editor of Saint John's Ledger, \"had his ears cut off and was left unconscious by thugs who had been lying in wait for him after dark\". The fate of Winton was to be his printer's as well. \nThe Authorities, who were not on friendly terms with the Ledger, made little to no effort to apprehend the culprits. In another case, a \"Gentleman by the name Parsons\", of the Newfoundland Patriot, \"was sentenced to three months imprisonment in another incident\".\n\nNova Scotia\nAs was the case in many early Canadian regions, the newspapers were the first source of the Parliamentary debates. Canada's first newspaper, the Halifax Gazette, was printed on Grafton street in Halifax in 1752. The two most prominent papers in Parliamentary reporting were the Acadian Recorder, founded in 1813 by Anthony Henry Holland, and the Free Press, established in 1816 by Edward Ward. Both newspapers reported the debates of the House of Assembly starting in 1817.\n\nThe Family Compact of Nova Scotia, nicknamed \"the little compact\", \"viewed the admission of reporters to the Assembly with disdain\" and \"were not slow to react whenever they felt the slightest affront\". There are many cases which exemplify the \"struggle to obtain freedom of the press and parliamentary reportings in the Maritimes\" as in the case of William Minns in 1823, who was forced to appear before the bar of the house, and William Milne, who was jailed for not being able to pay his debts.\n\nThe Novascotian newspaper would soon become Nova Scotia's most prominent paper after its launch in 1824, which was highly influenced by George Young who was instrumental in its establishment. George Young sought permission from the Assembly to report its debates. Permission was granted, yet he was not provided with very many privileges in the House. They didn't make it easy for him and didn't allow him a seat in the lower deck.\n\nIn 1827 Joseph Howe bought the Novascotian from Young. \"There was no more powerful an advocate of parliamentary debates than Howe\". In 1835 Joseph Howe was \"prosecuted over a publication of a letter in the Novascotian\". He was charged with libel. This case was infamous and is considered to be a \"cornerstone in the establishment of freedom of the press in Canada\". Howe, who defended himself in court, was found to be Not Guilty. This is why his case is viewed as a milestone in the development of the free press.\n\nOntario\n\nNo official record of the debates in the provincial Legislature was produced before 1944. The debates were reported in various newspapers; the provincial archives clipped and collected these reports in a series of scrapbooks until 1953. The provincial website now posts Hansard online, with records from March 29, 1977, to current.\n\nAlberta\nAlberta adopted a Hansard in 1972. From 1905 to 1971, local newspapers reported on legislative proceedings, and from these articles the Legislature Library has compiled a Scrapbook Hansard, which is available online. News reporters were allowed to take handwritten notes in the Chamber, but they could not make sound recordings, and members of the public were not allowed to take notes.\n\nIn 1965 a recording system was installed in the Chamber. Initially the Clerk's office provided transcription only for special events, such as throne speeches, but requests from MLAs for transcripts increased, and by 1971 all House proceedings were being recorded. On March 8, 1972, the government introduced a motion to create Alberta Hansard, and the following day they brought forward a motion allowing audio and video recording in the Chamber and also permitting visitors to the galleries to take notes. Assembly standing orders 115 and 116 set out the rules for broadcast media in the Chamber and at committee meetings, respectively.\n\nHansard staff verifies the names of individuals and entities mentioned in the House. Like other Hansards, Alberta Hansard follows editorial guidelines established in the 19th century, and transcripts are substantially verbatim. Revisions are limited to \"the correction of grammar, spelling and punctuation, ensuring that the correct parliamentary forms are observed, and minimizing superfluous repetition and redundancies, but no material alterations shall be made, nor any amendments that would in any way tend to change the sense of what has been spoken.\"\n\nTranscripts for Legislative Assembly of Alberta proceedings from 1972 onward are available online, and current issues are usually posted within 12 hours of the day's sitting. A transcript for a regular afternoon Assembly sitting of 4.5 hours contains more than 30,000 words. Also available online are transcripts for meetings of committees of the Legislative Assembly from the 1990s onward, earlier for some committees.\n\nBritish Columbia\n\nNo complete official record of the debates in the British Columbia Legislature was produced until 1972; a partial record was issued beginning in 1970. Unlike the Ottawa Hansard, opposition members and government backbenchers are identified only by initial and last name: \"A. Wilkinson\". Current cabinet ministers have their names prefaced with \"Honourable\": \"Hon. S. Hagen\". Interjections giving rise to a call for order by the Speaker are reported only as \"Interjection\". Other interjections are reported as spoken if they are clearly audible and if they are responded to in some way by the member who has the floor. While the details of approval or negativing of motions and bills closely parallel the House of Commons, the reporting is simplified to a style line (\"Motion approved\" or \"Motion negatived\").\n\nAustralia\nThe Parliament of Australia also keeps record of debates, using the term Hansard. The records are published by the State Law Publisher. The Parliament of South Australia was the first convict free Australian colony to use Hansard; where it became a convention from 1857.  The Parliament of Victoria followed the lead of South Australia by introducing the use of Hansard in 1866. The Parliament of New South Wales commenced its Hansard system on 28 October 1879 with the reporting of the Legislative Council at the opening of the Third Session of the Ninth Parliament.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nOn 9 July 1867 a team of five reporters, led by Chief Reporter C.C.N. Barron, produced the first official report of debates of the New Zealand Parliament. Ever since that day official transcripts of members' speeches in the New Zealand House of Representatives have been continuously published.\n\nToday the New Zealand Hansard is produced by a team of 17 FTE Hansard Editors within the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Hansard is published on the New Zealand Parliament website each day the House sits, and later indexed bound volumes are produced.\n\nSpeeches are transcribed directly from digital recordings of the debate, with staff present in the debating chamber to monitor the debate by recording the sequence of speakers and any interjections. Interjections are reported only if the member speaking replies to them or remarks on them during the course of his or her speech. Hansard Editors follow strict rules on what changes they can make to the words members use in the chamber. Hansard is as close to verbatim as possible, although Hansard Editors remove repetitions and redundancies and make minor grammatical corrections. Members are provided draft copies of their speeches at the same time that the speeches are first published on the Parliament website. Members can request correction of inadvertent factual inaccuracies but they are unable to significantly change what they said in the House.\n\nList of assemblies using the system\n\n Parliament of the United Kingdom and the UK's devolved institutions\n Parliament of Canada and the Canadian provincial and territorial legislatures\n Parliament of Australia and the Australian state and territory parliaments\n Parliament of South Africa and South Africa's provincial legislatures\n Parliament of Barbados\n East African Legislative Assembly\n New Zealand Parliament\n Legislative Council of Hong Kong\n Parliament of Malaysia and the Malaysian state legislatures\n National Parliament of Papua New Guinea\n Parliament of Singapore\n Legislative Council of Brunei\n Parliament of Sri Lanka\n Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago\n National Assembly of Kenya\n National Assembly of Tanzania\n Parliament of Ghana\n Parliament of Uganda\n Parliament of Mauritius\n Parliament of Jamaica\n National Assembly of Seychelles\n States of Jersey\n States of Guernsey\n Tynwald, the Parliament of the Isle of Man\n National Assembly of Nigeria\n National Assembly of Namibia\n Parliament of Botswana\n Parliament of Zimbabwe\n\nSee also\n List of British colonial gazettes\n Congressional Record, the equivalent for the United States\n Court reporter\n Fuddle duddle\n Hansard Society\n Pepper v Hart\n TheyWorkForYou\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n Hansard from 1803 to 2005\n The records of the House of Lords Official Report (Hansard) are held by the UK Parliamentary Archives\n The records of the Parliamentary Register, 1743-1786 are held by the UK Parliamentary Archives\n Parliamentary Archives, Hansard Publications and Papers\n\nTranscripts of legislative proceedings\nWestminster system", "machine_text": " Hansard is the name given to the printed or digital record of parliamentary debates and proceedings. It is named after Thomas Hansard, an English printer who first published the reports of the House of Commons in the early 19th century. The term has since been adopted by other countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, to refer to their own parliamentary records.\n\nThe Hansard report is an important tool for understanding the workings of a parliamentary democracy. It provides a detailed record of what was said in parliament, including the speeches, questions, and debates that took place during a particular session. This information is valuable for a variety of purposes, including historical research, legal analysis, and political science studies.\n\nIn Canada, Hansard is produced by the House of Commons and the Senate, and is available in both official languages, English and French. The reports are published on a daily basis during parliamentary sessions, and are also made available online. In addition to the written record, Hansard also includes audio and video recordings of debates and proceedings.\n\nThe Australian Parliament also produces a Hansard report, which is published by the Department of the Senate. The report includes a record of all parliamentary debates, as well as committee hearings and other parliamentary proceedings. The Australian Hansard is available online, and can be searched by topic, speaker, or date.\n\nIn India, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the two houses of the Indian Parliament, produce their own Hansard reports. The reports are published in English, Hindi, and other regional languages, and are available online. The Indian Hansard includes a record of all parliamentary debates, as well as questions and answers, and committee reports.\n\nThe production of Hansard reports is a complex process that involves a number of different steps. First, the proceedings of parliament are recorded by stenographers or audio recorders. The recordings are then transcribed, edited, and proofread to ensure accuracy and clarity. The reports are then typeset and printed, or made available online.\n\nIn recent years, the production of Hansard reports has become more digital, with many parliaments now producing online-only reports. These reports often include features such as searchable databases, video and audio recordings, and links to related documents. The digital format has also made it easier to access and analyze the data contained in Hansard reports.\n\nOne of the most important functions of Hansard is to provide a historical record of parliamentary proceedings. The reports can be used to track changes in policy, examine the evolution of political ideas, and understand the role of parliament in shaping the laws and policies of a country.\n\nIn addition to its historical value, Hansard is also an important tool for legal analysis. The reports can be used to study the legislative process, examine the intent of legislators, and understand the context in which laws were passed.\n\nHansard is also used by political scientists to study the workings of parliamentary democracy. The reports can be used to analyze the behavior of politicians, examine the dynamics of party politics, and understand the role of parliament in shaping public policy.\n\nIn conclusion, Hansard is an important tool for understanding the workings of parliamentary democracy.

During the reign of the Shah kings, the Mulkajis (Chief Kajis) or Chautariyas served as prime ministers in a council of 4 Chautariyas, 4 Kajis, and sundry officers. These Bharadars (officers) were drawn from high caste and politically influential families such as the Pande, Basnyat, and Thapa families. The nobility of Gorkha was mainly based from Chetri families and they had a strong presence in civil administration affairs. All prime ministers of Nepal between 1768 and 1950 were Chhetris with the exception of Ranga Nath Poudyal, being a Khas Brahmin. Of the 23 men who have been elected since Nepal attained democracy from the Ranas in 1951, 15 have been Khas Brahmin, 3 Thakuri, 2 Newar Shresthas, 2 Chhetri, and 1 Sanyasi/Dasnami. The executive power allocation was fluctuating between Kajis and Chautariyas.\n\nIn 1804, a single authoritative position of Mukhtiyar was created by Rana Bahadur Shah which carried the executive powers of nation. Mukhtiyar held the position of head of the executive until the adoption of the title of Prime Minister in November 1843 by Mathabar Singh Thapa who became Mukhtiyar as well as Prime Minister and the Chief of the Nepalese Army. During the Rana dynasty, the position of prime minister was hereditary and the officeholder held additional titles \u2014 Maharaja of Lambjang and Kaski, Supreme Commander-in-Chief of Nepal and Grand Master of the Royal Orders of Nepal.\n\nAfter the revolution of 1951, non-aristocratic citizens like Matrika Prasad Koirala held the position of prime minister still under the authority of the King of Nepal. The first general election was held in 1959 and Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala became the first elected prime minister of Nepal. However, he was deposed and imprisoned in the 1960 coup d'\u00e9tat by King Mahendra who went on to establish an oligarchic authoritative regime, the Panchayat system, and Nepal did not have a democratic government until 1990. After the Jana Andolan movement in 1990, the country became a constitutional monarchy. However, this was interrupted with the 2005 coup d'\u00e9tat by King Gyanendra. After the Loktantrik Andolan movement in 2006, the monarchy was abolished on 28 May 2008 by the 1st Constituent Assembly and the country was declared a federal parliamentary republic. The current constitution was adopted on 20 September 2015, and the first prime minister under this new constitution was Khagendra Prasad Sharma Oli.\n\nHeads of government of the Kingdom of Nepal (1768\u20132008)\n\nBefore 1800s\n\nMul-Kajis and Muktiyars during the Shah expansion era and before the Rana era\n\nPrime ministers during the Rana era (1846\u20131951)\n\nPrime ministers during the Transition era (1951\u20131960)\n\nPrime ministers during the partyless Panchayat era (1960\u20131990)\n\nPrime ministers during the Constitutional monarchy (1990\u20132008)\n\nPrime ministers of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal (2008\u2013present)\n\nLiving former prime ministers\nAs of  , there are seven living former prime ministers.\n\nSee also\nKing of Nepal\nPresident of Nepal\nGovernment of Nepal\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nNotes\n\nBooks\n\nExternal links\n Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers\n\n \n\nNepal\nPrime Ministers", "machine_text": " Sure, here's a possible Wikipedia article with the title \"List of Prime Ministers of Nepal\":\n\nList of Prime Ministers of Nepal\n\nNepal, a country located in South Asia, has had a total of 13 prime ministers since its establishment as a constitutional monarchy in 1951.

He was the co-founder with Morton Subotnick of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in 1962. He is the son of Spanish writer Ram\u00f3n J. Sender.\n\nEducation\nSender was born in Madrid, Spain, and left the country during the civil war following the Fascist coup there in 1936. He studied piano with George Copeland, harmony with Elliott Carter, and counterpoint and fugue with Harold Shapero (1948\u20131951). Sender attended the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome and Columbia University in New York, where he studied with Henry Cowell.  He also studied with Robert Erickson at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music (1959\u20131962) and at Mills College, where he studied with Darius Milhaud. Sender holds a Bachelor of Music degree from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and an M.A. from Mills College.\n\nSan Francisco Tape Music Center\nSender co-founded the San Francisco Tape Music Center in 1962 with Morton Subotnick and also collaborated with composers and visual artists including Pauline Oliveros, Tony Martin, Joseph Byrd, Terry Riley, William Maginnis, and many others until 1966 when the Center was incorporated into Mills College.  It was later named the Mills Center for Contemporary Music and continues to function today.\n\nSender participated with Don Buchla and Morton Subotnick in the design of the Buchla Box, one of the first music synthesizers.\n\nMorningstar and Wheeler Ranches\n\nIn January 1966, he co-produced the Trips Festival with Ken Kesey and Stewart Brand. It was a three-day event that, in conjunction with The Merry Pranksters, brought together the nascent hippie movement for the first time.\n\nIn April 1966, Sender became the first resident at Lou Gottlieb's Morning Star Ranch (Sender has, at times, referred to himself as Ramon Sender Morningstar) open land commune, which evolved into a Digger Farm / open land commune in 1967.  After the residents' homes were bulldozed by Sonoma County authorities three times, he moved into the Wheeler Ranch in Occidental, California. Currently both properties have reverted to private ownership. Sender continued living and working in the area until 1980 when he returned to San Francisco. As \"His Imperial Nothingness, Zero the Clown,\" he has continued appearing in the annual Occidental Fools Parade.\n\nOne of the residents at Wheeler at Ranch was Alicia Bay Laurel, a visual artist, author and singer-songwriter known for her 1970 best-seller Living on the Earth.  He collaborated with her on another book, Being of the Sun, which contains information about homemade music, drones, modes, and open tunings as a means of spiritual growth, as well as information about yoga, creating ritual, and forming intentional communities. In 1973, Sender made a reel-to-reel recording of himself and Laurel performing songs, chants and improvisations from the book, which Laurel released in 2013 as a CD on her record label, Indigo With Stars, titled Songs from Being of the Sun.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Sender was one of the founding members of The Occidental Community Choir (the nearest town to the Wheeler Ranch commune), for whom he wrote original music and shared his skills as a choral arranger. The choir's rendition of Sender's arrangement of Laurel's song, \"In the Morning\" appears on her CD, Music from Living on the Earth.\n\nIn 2006, stage producer, arranger and bassist Nicholas Alva created a musical based on the story of the open land communes Morningstar and Wheeler Ranch, including songs by Sender. In 2020 the music and dialogue were recorded and released as an ebook.\n\nSender co-curated \"The Hippies,\" an exhibition re-telling in written narration, photography, art and memorabilia, the history of the west Sonoma County Open Land communes, at the West County Museum in Sebastopol, California (part of the Sonoma County Historical Society.) Running from October 30, 2016 to March 5, 2017, it was the most popular exhibition ever at the West County Museum.\n\nLater Years in San Francisco\n\nIn 1980, Sender returned to San Francisco where he married his long-time friend Judith Levy-Sender, who taught in the San Francisco School District for thirty years. A poet and self-taught artist, he helped her publish two books of poems and artwork, the last titled \"Transitions Visible and Invisible.\" Collaborating with her, they founded the Odd Mondays speaker series that they ran for eighteen years before turning it over to a new producer.\n\nSender is also a visual artist whose visual works are sampled on his web site and in a 2009 book, Barayon, a Catalog of Prints, Drawings, Original Art.  The book is based on a one-man show at the Gallery Sanchez in 2008.\n\nAfter the death of Sender's daughter Xaverie in 1989, he founded the Peregrine Foundation (for people \"living in or exiting from experimental social groups\"). He was the administrator of the foundation until 1999 and published four full-length autobiographies of women who had left the Bruderhof community in a series titled \"Women from Utopia.\"\n\nSender identifies himself as a \"transcendental, post-monotheist hippie pagan sun worshipper, with one foot planted in the nondual teaching of Julie Henderson and the other in the Archaic Revival culture\".\n\nIn 2018, Spanish documentary filmmaker Luis Olano released Sender Baray\u00f3n Un Viaje Hacia La Luz (A Trip into the Light), a film about the life and works of Ram\u00f3n Sender Baray\u00f3n, including interviews with Sender at his home in San Francisco, archival photos and footage, and recordings of Sender's music.  The film has English subtitles whenever Spanish is spoken, and Spanish subtitles whenever English is spoken, and has been screened in the USA and in Spain.

Sender, a well-known Spanish novelist, he uses the Spanish-style name Ram\u00f3n Sender Baray\u00f3n.  This is also to honor his late mother Amparo Baray\u00f3n.\n\nSender's novel Zero Weather was published in 1980.  He has several other unpublished manuscripts and some of his short stories are published on the internet.\n\nIn 1989, Sender published A Death in Zamora, a book investigating the execution of his mother by Franco's forces during the Spanish Civil War. The book has been recognized not only as a valuable record of the Spanish Civil War, but as a historical account of early feminism and rebellion against patriarchy in Spain, of which his mother, Amparo Baray\u00f3n, was a pioneer. An updated edition (2018), based on the Spanish Post-Metropolis Editorial 2017 edition, contains essays by renowned Spanish Civil War historians Paul Preston, Helen Graham and Francisco Espinosa Maestre. His cousin Medcedes Esteban Maes-Kemp assisted as translator.\n\nRecently, he published an anthology of his short stories and essays, titled A Planetary Sojourn. He also wrote a novel based on his experiences at the Tape Music Center, entitled Naked Close Up, which was published in 2012 as an ebook by Intelligent Arts Publishing, a project of The Electronic Music Foundation in Albany, New York.\n\nMusic\n\"Donkey Gruntler Serenade\", audience participation on Donkey Gruntlers with pre-recorded tape \u2013 2003 live quartet performance by Luciano Chessa and friends\n\"Aidan's Gamelan (in memory of Lou Harrison)\", audience participation on tuned water drums with pre-recorded tape \u2013 2003\n\"Seashore Snake Sizzle,\" audience participation on rattles with pre-recorded tape \u2013 2003\n\"Audition\" for two open-tuned autoharps and dalruba \u2013 1982\n\"Great-Grandpa Lemuel's Death-Rattle What-In-Tarnation Reincarnation Blues\", dixieland band, accordion, tape \u2013 1981\n\"A Tewa Prayer\", mixed chorus \u2013 1978\n\"I Have a Dream\", mixed chorus \u2013 1978\nLoopy Gamelan \"Oh 'C' Can You Say\", for Oakland Children's Chorus \u2013 1976\nLoopy Gamelans on 'A' and 'B' for four performers \u2013 1976\n\"64 I Ching Chants\" (instructions) \u2013 1976\n\"Outdoor Music for four Open-tuned Autoharps\" \u2013 1970\n\"Enoughing,\" tape \u2013 1968; \"Ushas\", tape \u2013 1968; \"Xmas Me\", tape \u2013 1968\n\"In the Garden\", clarinet, viola, projections and tape \u2013 1965\n\"Desert Ambulance\", amplified accordion, voice, 3-track tape, projections \u2013 1964\n\"Balances\", amplified str qt (with db) \u2013 1964\n\"Tropical Fish Opera\", four instruments \u2013 1962\n\"Time Fields\", sextet \u2013 1962 (Pacifica Directors Award, 1963)\n\"Traversals\", tape \u2013 1961\n\"Kronos\", tape composition (approx 15 minutes) \u2013 1962\n\"Kore\", tape \u2013 1961\n\"Four Sanskrit Hymns\", four singers, four cellos, double bass, harp, piano, celesta, three percussionists, tape \u2013 1961\n\nRecordings\n Various works included on the DVD published with the book in David Bernstein's The San Francisco Tape Music Center: 1960s counterculture and the avant-garde,  (2008, University of California Press)\nDesert Ambulance (2005, Locust 70)\nWorldfood (2004, Locust 55)\nMusic from Mills, an anthology which contains a short excerpt from his \"Audition\" (1986, Mills MC 001)\nSongs from Being of the Sun remastered archival (1973) reel-to-reel recordings of Ram\u00f3n Sender Baray\u00f3n and Alicia Bay Laurel performing songs, chants and improvisations from their book, Being of the Sun.

He was born in Claines, near Worcester, the son of James Dyson Perrins, the owner of the Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce factory and the grandson of William Perrins, co-originator of the Lea & Perrins secret recipe.\n\nBiography\nHe was educated at Charterhouse School and The Queen's College, Oxford, and then served in the Highland Light Infantry. After the death of his father, he took over management of Lea & Perrins. His father had also been a director of Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory, and Charles followed him, becoming a director in 1891. He became chairman in 1901, and supported the factory financially. He bought the company outright in 1934 and ensured its continuity from his own fortune, until it could be taken public in 1954.\n\nIn 1927, he purchased the Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory's historic ceramics collection for a price above market value, to assist the firm's cashflow. In 1946, he established the Perrins Trust to unite the factory museum collection and his own private holdings of Royal Worcester and ensure their survival. After his death, his widow established the \"Dyson Perrins Museum\" at the factory site to house the collection. It is now called \"The Museum of Royal Worcester\" (previously \"Worcester Porcelain Museum\").\n\nPerrins lived in Malvern for most of his life and amongst his many charitable deeds in Worcestershire was the endowment of Dyson Perrins Church of England Academy in Malvern. He served as Mayor of Worcester for 1897\u201398 and as High Sheriff of Worcestershire for 1899\u20131900.\n\nHe was a major benefactor of the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, and endowed new buildings including Perrins Hall (1914) named after his father, an old boy. The school organ is in this building and is played regularly at assemblies. He became a Six Master and chairman of the governors of that school until the 1950s. His portrait by A. Hacker c. 1907 hangs in the hall.\n\nIn Oxford, he funded the building of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, which was the main centre for research into organic chemistry at Oxford University from its foundation in 1916 until its retirement as a laboratory in 2003. He received an honorary DCL from Oxford University.\n\nDuring Perrins's life he amassed one of the most important book collections in the world, particularly strong in medieval illuminated manuscripts and printed ballads. To help finance and re-establish the Royal Worcester factory after World War II, he decided to sell his important collection of early printed books, and they were mostly dispersed in a series of sales at Sotheby's in London in 1946 and 1947. His illuminated manuscripts and other remaining printed books were sold after his death in three major auction sales in 1958 to 1960. A record total for a single collection of \u00a31,100,000 was raised by these sales. Items once owned by C. W. Dyson Perrins now form the basis of many other prominent collections, such as the Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection now in the Library of Congress.\n\nMany other items from his collection were given or bequeathed by him to public institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, Winchester Cathedral library, and the British Museum. For example, his Mughal manuscript the Emperor Akbar's Khamsa of Nizami is now in the British Library and Palestrina by J. M. W. Turner is in the National Gallery.\n\nFamily\n\nPerrins married:\n Catherine Christina Gregory at St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh in October 1889. They had five children.

He was the eldest of three children born to William Perrins, a clerk, and his wife, Elizabeth. Perrins' early life was marked by hardship and tragedy, with the death of his mother when he was just six years old, followed by the death of his father four years later. Despite these challenges, Perrins was determined to succeed and make a name for himself in the world of business.\n\nAfter completing his elementary education, Perrins began his career as a office boy at the age of 14. He quickly proved himself to be a diligent and hardworking employee, and soon rose through the ranks to become a junior partner at the firm of Smith, Elder & Co., a prominent publishing company.\n\nIn 1890, Perrins married his first wife, Annie Elizabeth Jones, and the couple had two children together. Tragically, Annie died in 1894, leaving Perrins a widower with two young children to care for. Despite this setback, Perrins continued to work hard and eventually became a partner at the firm of S.P. Jenkinson & Co., where he played a key role in developing the company's perfume business.\n\nThe Perfume Industry\n\nPerrins' entry into the perfume industry marked a significant turning point in his career. He recognized the potential for perfume to become a major industry, and he was determined to play a leading role in its development. Through his work at S.P. Jenkinson & Co., Perrins became familiar with the French perfume industry and was impressed by the quality and sophistication of French perfumes. He saw an opportunity to introduce these perfumes to the British market and, in 1903, he founded the company that would become Coty, Inc., one of the world's largest and most successful perfume companies.\n\nUnder Perrins' leadership, Coty, Inc. quickly became synonymous with high-quality perfumes, and the company's products were sought after by royalty, celebrities, and discerning consumers around the world. Perrins was a master marketer and was able to create a sense of luxury and exclusivity around his products, which helped to drive sales and fuel the company's growth.\n\nPhilanthropy and Later Life\n\nIn addition to his success in the perfume industry, Perrins was also a dedicated philanthropist. He was a generous supporter of various charitable causes, including the Boy Scouts Association, the Red Cross, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Perrins was also a passionate advocate for the arts, and he was a significant benefactor of the Royal Academy of Arts.\n\nIn 1934, Perrins married his second wife, Lily Hilda Gwendoline Fraser, and the couple had one son together. Perrins continued to work until his retirement in 1954, when he was 90 years old. He died four years later, on February 2, 1958, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneer in the perfume industry and a dedicated philanthropist.\n\nLegacy\n\nCharles William Dyson Perrins' impact on the perfume industry cannot be overstated. Through his work at Coty, Inc., he helped to create a global market for perfume and introduced French perfumes to the British market. His legacy continues to be felt today, as Coty, Inc. remains one of the world's leading perfume companies.\n\nPerrins' philanthropic efforts also continue to have a lasting impact. His support for various charitable causes has helped to improve the lives of countless individuals and families, and his advocacy for the arts has helped to preserve and promote cultural heritage.\n\nIn conclusion, Charles William Dyson Perrins was a visionary businessman and philanthropist who played a significant role in shaping the modern perfume industry. Through his work at Coty, Inc., he introduced high-quality French perfumes to the British market and helped to create a global market for perfume. His philanthropic efforts continue to have a positive impact on society, and his legacy as a pioneer in the perfume industry will be remembered for generations to come.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2618531}

The initial movement cycle also remains largely unchanged.\n\nThe movement cycle which is most crucial to the methodology and reinforces the spaced repetition, begins with either 3, 4 or 5 cards; 3 cards for a 6-card session, 4 cards for a 10-card session and 5 cards for the most advanced 15-card session. Because two-sided associative cue-cards are being used, all cards are presented with a congruent side up, either all \"terms\" or \"definitions,\" not mixed.\n\nOnce cards have been answered correctly, the predominant row has reached its maximum and a card must be graduated out of this row to continue the game. Thus the card to the far right comes into play.  Routines are repeated as each row reaches its maximum. A cue-card is finally eliminated from the game session by being answered correctly once more, after it has graduated to the top tier or row.\n\nTriangular Movement Cycle\n\nThe first manifestation, referred to as the \"Triangular Movement Cycle\" or TMC, was a simple paper-based learning technique that was primarily a manual movement cycle using physical cue-cards, which allowed for manual-spaced repetition to elicit psychological retention of information. Its origins, however, are not very clear. Using TMC, teachers would move the cards for the student in a one-on-one setting according to either the correct or incorrect feedback from the student. This presented challenges for the teacher or tutor using this method. The first challenge lies in the fact that, although TMC lent itself well to a two-party learning group (i.e. teacher & student), it could also be done by the student themselves on their own. It was a very easy system to utilize once learned, however, it was found exceptionally difficult to teach the complex movement cycle and principles behind such to students, especially where a linguistic barrier was present. The second challenge lay in that the educator needed to create and remember innumerable cue-cards or create custom master lists in order to know the correct answers \u2014 and properly guide the student, thus progressing or digressing the card in play. TMC often failed to keep the attention of many students owing to the fact that cards were not very visually appealing. To make them so required tremendous effort \u2014 and was very time consuming.\n\nThe term \"Pythagorean Method of Memorization\" was coined in 2013 and officially copyrighted in October 2014 by a Canadian company named You Learn Educational Solutions & Linguistics Inc. PYMOM takes the movement cycle from TMC and remedied the challenge of teaching the movement cycle itself to students by providing a software-based solution to handling cycles by means of sub-routines prompted by the user\u2019s input.\n\nPYMOM wove established educational theory into the fabric of TMC to create a viable educational platform for academic and linguistic study by several means. Because spaced repetition is intrinsically part of the movement-cycle subroutines, it adds to the content and surrounding experience making it into a platform. The developers of PYMOM describe it as an \u201corganic learning experience.\u201d The tenets that truly allow a learning system to be a PYMOM-based system are enumerated thusly: The Von Restorff effect: for example, where it features a language, this method is employed to further aid in memory retention of the highlighted word in the phrase.\n\nChromatics: there are no white backgrounds where learning takes place.\nPositive Reinforcement: There are no truly \"wrong\" responses, only mistakes. These mistakes are greeted by neutral reinforcement and \"correct\" responses are rewarded with positive reinforcement.\nPicture Association: Visual aids should accompany concept-based material.\nSelective Musical Tonality: the learning experience should always incorporate music; generally instrumental, that aids learning by increasing focus and reducing stress (which inhibits learning).\nKinesthetics: whether by utilizing a touch-screen, key board or mouse, a level of physical movement should always be present while learning to further increase retention.\nThe Serial Position Effect: taking breaks at specific, regular intervals to aid in learning and reduce stress levels.\nMeditation: a session of meditation should be incorporated into every learning session to allow for further retention of the information.\n\nReferences\n\nLearning methods\nCognitive training", "machine_text": " Pythagorean Method of Memorization\n\nThe Pythagorean method of memorization is a technique used to improve memory by utilizing mathematical concepts, such as numbers and geometric shapes, to encode and retrieve information. This method is based on the idea that the human brain is wired to recognize and remember patterns, and that by using mathematical patterns, it is possible to enhance memory capacity and retention.\n\nThe method is named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, who is said to have used this technique to memorize large amounts of information. The method involves several steps, including the creation of a mental grid or matrix, the assignment of numerical values to items to be remembered, and the use of geometric shapes to encode and retrieve information.\n\nTo use the Pythagorean method of memorization, one must first create a mental grid or matrix. This can be done by imagining a square or rectangular grid with a specific number of rows and columns. Each intersection point on the grid represents a location where information can be stored.\n\nNext, the items to be remembered are assigned numerical values. This can be done by associating each item with a specific number, such as a date, a name, or a code. The numerical values are then placed at the intersection points on the grid.\n\nOnce the items have been assigned numerical values and placed on the grid, the next step is to use geometric shapes to encode and retrieve the information. This can be done by imagining lines, circles, or other geometric shapes that connect the intersection points where the information is stored. By visualizing these shapes, it is possible to create a mental map of the information and recall it more easily.\n\nFor example, if one wanted to remember a list of 10 items using the Pythagorean method, they might create a mental grid with 10 rows and 10 columns. Each intersection point would represent a location where information can be stored. The items to be remembered would be assigned numerical values, such as 1-10, and placed at the intersection points. To encode and retrieve the information, the person might imagine lines or shapes that connect the intersection points in a specific pattern.\n\nThe Pythagorean method of memorization has been found to be effective in improving memory capacity and retention. By using mathematical patterns and visualization techniques, it is possible to encode and retrieve information more efficiently than with traditional memorization methods. Additionally, the method can be used to remember a wide range of information, including dates, names, numbers, and other types of data.\n\nIn conclusion, the Pythagorean method of memorization is a powerful technique for improving memory capacity and retention. By utilizing mathematical concepts and visualization techniques, it is possible to encode and retrieve information more efficiently than with traditional methods. This method has been used by memory champions and experts to remember large amounts of information, and it can be used by anyone looking to improve their memory skills.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1875925}

In the northwest, it connects with the Red Sea through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, and it connects with the Arabian Sea to the east. To the west, it narrows into the Gulf of Tadjoura in Djibouti. \n\nThe ancient Greeks regarded the gulf as one of the most important parts of the Erythraean Sea. It later came to be dominated by Muslims, as the area around the gulf converted to Islam. From the late 1960s onwards, there started to be an increased Soviet naval presence in the Gulf. The importance of the Gulf of Aden declined when the Suez Canal was closed, but it was revitalized when the canal was reopened in 1975, after being deepened and widened by the Egyptian government.\n\nThe waterway is part of the important Suez Canal shipping route between the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Sea in the Indian Ocean, with 21,000 ships crossing the gulf annually. This route is often used for the delivery of Persian Gulf oil, making the gulf an integral waterway in the world economy. Important cities along the Gulf of Aden include the namesake Aden in Yemen. Other Yemeni cities are Zinjibar, Shuqrah, Ahwar, Balhaf, Mukalla. On the Horn African side, the cities of Djibouti, and Bosaso.\n\nDespite a lack of large-scale commercial fishing facilities, the coastline supports many isolated fishing towns and villages. The Gulf of Aden is richly supplied with fish, turtles, and lobsters. Local fishing takes place close to the shore; sardines, tuna, kingfish, and mackerel make up the bulk of the annual catches. Crayfish and sharks are also fished locally.\n\nHistorical Names\n\nIn antiquity, the modern-day Gulf of Aden was seen as an extension of the Erythraean Sea (Red Sea) , Erythr\u00e0 Th\u00e1lassa in Ancient Greek geography. The Greeks named several islands within the gulf, including Stratonis Insula, although it is no longer clear which existing islands had which Greek names.\n\nIn Abu'l-Fida's, A Sketch of the Countries (), the present-day Gulf of Aden was called the Gulf of Berbera, which shows how important Berbera was in both regional and international trade during the medieval period.\n\nLegendary navigator Ibn Majid referred to the Gulf of Aden as the Gulf of Berbera in his 15th century magnum opus The Book of the Benefits of the Principles and Foundations of Seamanship. In his description of the Somali coast and wider Indian Ocean he used the then contemporary reference to the Gulf as being named after Berbera like Abu'l-Fida before him. Berbera has been a prominent port since antiquity\n\nGeography\n\nLimits\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Gulf of Aden as follows:\n\nOn the west \u2013 The southern limit of the Red Sea [A line joining Hisn Murad () and Ras Siyyan ()].\n\nOn the west \u2013 The eastern limit of the Gulf of Tadjoura (A line joining Obock and Lawyacado).\n\nOn the East \u2013 The Arabian Sea.\n\nHydrography\nThe temperature of the Gulf of Aden varies between  and , depending on the season and the appearance of monsoons. The salinity of the gulf at  depth varies from 35.3 \u2030 along the eastern Somali coast to as high as 37.3 \u2030 in the gulf's center, while the oxygen content in the Gulf of Aden at the same depth is typically between 4.0 and 5.0\u00a0mg/L.\n\nExclusive economic zone\nExclusive economic zones in Gulf of Aden:\n\nEconomy\n\nThe Gulf of Aden is a vital waterway for shipping, especially for Persian Gulf oil, making it an integral waterway in the world economy.  Approximately 11% of the world's seaborne petroleum passes through the Gulf of Aden on its way to the Suez Canal or to regional refineries. The main ports along the gulf are Aden, Balhaf, Bir Ali, Mukalla, and Shokra in Yemen; Djibouti City in Djibouti; Zeila, Berbera, Maydh and Las Khorey in Somaliland and Bosaso in Somalia.\n\nIn antiquity, the gulf was a thriving area of international trade between Ptolemaic Egypt and Rome in the west and Classical India, its Indonesian colonies, and Han China in the east. It was not limited to transshipment, as Yemeni incense, tortoiseshell, and other goods were in high demand in both directions. After Egyptian sailors discovered the monsoon winds and began to trade directly with India, caravan routes and their associated kingdoms began to collapse, leading to a rise in piracy in the area.  The 1st-century Periplus of the Erythraean Sea documents one Egyptian captain's experiences during this era.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Roman economy, direct trade ceased but the Awsan I port Crater, located just south of the modern city of Aden, remained an important regional center. In late antiquity and the early medieval period, there were several invasions of Yemen from Ethiopia; after the rise of Islam, the gulf permitted repeated migrations of northwest Africa by Arab settlers.\n\nIn the late 2000s, the gulf evolved into a hub of pirate activity. By 2013, attacks in the waters had steadily declined due to active private security and international navy patrols. India receives US$50\u00a0billion in imports and sends US$60\u00a0billion in exports through this area annually. Due to this, and for the sake of protecting the trade of other countries, India keeps a warship escort in this area.\n\nEcology\n\nA geologically young body of water, the Gulf of Aden has a unique biodiversity that contains many varieties of fish, coral, seabirds and invertebrates. This rich ecological diversity has benefited from a relative lack of pollution during the history of human habitation around the gulf. However, environmental groups fear that the lack of a coordinated effort to control pollution may jeopardize the gulf's ecosphere. Whales, dolphins, and dugongs were once common before being severely reduced by commercial hunts, including by mass illegal hunts by Soviet Union and Japan in 1960s to 70s. Critically endangered Arabian humpback whales were once seen in large numbers, but only a few large whales still appear in the gulf waters,  including Bryde's whales, blue whales, and toothed whales inhabiting deep-seas such as sperm whales and tropical bottlenose whales.\n\nSee also\n\n Maritime Security Patrol Area\n International fleet of vessels in the Gulf of Aden\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n Space Station photograph of the Gulf of Aden and the Horn of Africa\n\n \nBodies of water of Somalia\nBodies of water of Yemen\nGreat Rift Valley\nBodies of water of the Arabian Sea\nPiracy by body of water\nAden\nBodies of water of the Red Sea\nBodies of water of Djibouti\nGulfs of Africa\nWestern Indo-Pacific", "machine_text": " Gulf of Aden\n\nThe Gulf of Aden is a body of water located in the Arabian Peninsula, connecting the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea. It is bordered by Yemen to the north, Oman to the northeast, and Somalia to the southeast. The gulf is approximately 1,200 km (750 mi) long and 300 km (190 mi) wide, with a maximum depth of 4,700 m (15,400 ft).\n\nGeography\n\nThe Gulf of Aden is a semi-enclosed sea, meaning it has limited connections to the open ocean. It is connected to the Red Sea through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, which is located between Yemen and Djibouti. The gulf is also connected to the Arabian Sea through the Gulf of Oman. The coastline of the gulf is characterized by rugged mountains, sandy beaches, and coral reefs. The gulf is home to several islands, including the island of Socotra, which is known for its unique biodiversity and is considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate of the Gulf of Aden is hot and humid, with temperatures ranging from 20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F) throughout the year. The gulf experiences a rainy season during the summer months, with the majority of the rain falling between June and September. The gulf is also known for its strong winds and rough seas, particularly during the monsoon season.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe Gulf of Aden is an important shipping route, with many cargo ships and oil tankers passing through the gulf en route to the Suez Canal. The gulf is also home to several major ports, including the port of Aden in Yemen, which is one of the busiest ports in the region. Fishing is also an important industry in the gulf, with many species of fish, including tuna, swordfish, and shrimp, being caught in the gulf's waters.\n\nEnvironmental Concerns\n\nThe Gulf of Aden is facing several environmental concerns, including pollution, overfishing, and climate change. The gulf is vulnerable to oil spills, particularly from tankers passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. The gulf is also home to several endangered species, including the green turtle, the hawksbill turtle, and the dolphin. Climate change is also having a significant impact on the gulf, with rising sea temperatures and sea levels posing a threat to the gulf's ecosystem.\n\nPolitical Tensions\n\nThe Gulf of Aden has been the site of several political tensions in recent years. The gulf has been a hotbed of piracy, with Somali pirates attacking cargo ships and oil tankers in the gulf. The gulf has also been a source of tension between Yemen and Oman, with both countries claiming sovereignty over several islands in the gulf. In addition, the gulf has been a source of tension between Yemen and Djibouti, with both countries disputing the border between the two countries.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Gulf of Aden is a vital body of water that plays a critical role in the global economy. However, the gulf is facing several environmental and political challenges that must be addressed in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the gulf. Efforts must be made to reduce pollution, protect endangered species, and address the impacts of climate change.

Created by the merger of Far Eastern College and the Institute of Accounts, Business, and Finance, FEU became a university in 1934 under the guidance of its first president, Nicanor Reyes Sr.  \n\nThe first accountancy and business school for Filipinos, the university, through the years, has expanded its course offerings to the arts and sciences, architecture, fine arts, education, engineering, computer studies, graduate studies, tourism and hotel management, law, nursing, and medicine. FEU has five campuses located in Metro Manila and Cavite. It offers programs from elementary, secondary, tertiary, to graduate school.\n\nFEU Manila comprises several Institutes that offer specific programs. The accountancy program, along with its other undergraduate programs, have received the highest Level IV accreditation from the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA). The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has also granted it as a Center of Development in Business Administration and a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education.\n\nSince its establishment in 1928, FEU has produced national artists, business tycoons, ambassadors, justices of the Supreme Court and other judicial bodies, technocrats in private and government sectors, finance wizards, acclaimed physicians, nurses, educators, theater and media luminaries and so many others in different fields of expertise.\n\nHistory\nThe Far Eastern University was founded in November 1933 when the Far Eastern College and the Institute of Accounts, Business, and Finance (IABF) merged. Far Eastern College, founded in 1919 by Vicente K. Fabella (the first Filipino CPA), Nicanor Maronilla-Seva, Francisco Africa, Pedro Cortez, and Salvador Unson, had been a liberal arts college in Quiapo; while the IABF had been established (originally under the name Institute of Accountancy) by Francisco Dalupan Sr. and Nicanor Reyes Sr., then head of the Department of Economics at the University of the Philippines, with a number of other prominent educators in 1928. IABF had been originally predominately used by night students, and the new University, which was supported by the tuition provided by its students rather than government grants, soon demonstrated that a private university was financially sustainable in the Philippines.\n\nIn the early 1930s, FEU was housed in a converted tobacco factory (La Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos y Compania; boundary of Quiapo and Sampaloc district lots) already present on the  property lot owned by Sulucan Hill subdivision. Due to the widening of the street that became Quezon Blvd., the original building designed and built by Architect Pablo Antonio Sr. (National Artist for Architecture) was demolished and had to be rebuilt on a bigger scale on what is the present campus of FEU.\n\nIn 1934, the Institute of Law was founded. Two years later, the Institute of Technology was founded, with Fransisco Santana its first dean. In April 1938, the FEU Junior College was opened in Lingayen, Pangasinan.\n\nNicanor Reyes Sr. was the first founding president of the university, which spent its early years establishing several of its institutes, including those of Law and Technology. Reyes Sr. commissioned Architect Pablo S. Antonio Sr., his brother in law and husband of his sister Marina del Rosario Reyes-Antonio, who would later be titled as National Artist under the National Artist of the Philippines awards, to construct the main building for the school. In 1939, the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall, which would later house the main library at third level and Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, opened. Two other buildings by Antonio, the Girls\u2019 High School Building and Boys High School Building, followed in 1940 and 1941, by which year FEU had 10,000 registered students, with an international student population of 400. Then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon hailed and called FEU \"the best non-sectarian institution in the country.\"\n\nIn 1941, FEU also had the first ROTC quartermaster and ROTC finance units in the Philippines. During the American colonial period FEU ROTC was notable for having the first Coastal Artillery unit in the Philippines. During World War II, FEU cadets fought in Bataan with the Second Infantry Division. FEU constituted the majority of cadets who received armor training. These cadets were trained to operate the American M5 light tank. At the time that the FEU's coast artillery unit was formed, the Philippine Army's Coast Artillery was equipped with the 155mm GPF gun. During the Philippine\u2013American War, the Philippine coast artillery had one 150mm Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez gun. It is said that of all the Philippine colleges whose students and alumni volunteered for military service at the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, FEU men formed the greatest number.\n\nIn 1942, the Far Eastern University campus was used as a multi-functional facility by the Imperial Japanese Army Transportation Corps. It was later used as the Prisoner of War Bureau for the Japanese Army.\n\nDuring World War II, the campus was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army as their base. The main building sustained bullet damage while the other three buildings (Girls High, Boys High, and the old Technology Building) did not.\n\nNicanor B. Reyes Sr. having been killed during the Japanese occupation, Hermengildo B. Reyes was appointed the second president of the university when it reopened in 1945.\n\nThe university was re-opened in October 1945 despite the use of most of its facilities by the American forces until their departure in May 1946, the post-liberation years saw the renaissance of FEU with its massive expansion of facilities aimed at meeting the demands of modern and relevant education in the country and the increasing student population. FEU was once named as the \u201cLargest University in Asia\u201d, in the early 1950s when its enrollment passed near 50,000 students.\n\nThereafter, FEU continued to expand, with the opening of the Science Building and the establishment of the Institute of Medicine and the School of Nursing. In 1955, the FEU Hospital was inaugurated. Humanities were introduced in 1959, and in 1970 the Institute of Architecture and Fine Arts opened. Also in 1970, the for-profit status of the Institute of Medicine, School of Medical Technology, FEU Hospital and the Student Health Service Clinic was altered, when these were converted into the Far Eastern University \u2013 Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation, a non-stock, non-profit educational foundation.\n\nIn 1989, Nicanor Reyes Jr. introduced substantial revitalization to FEU that took place over a number of years, with renovation and modernization of facilities and grounds and upgrading of the university's educational standard. This resulted in the accreditation of the Institute of Arts and Sciences, the Institute of Education, and the Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, and, in the mid-1990s, the deregulation of the university by the Commission on Higher Education. The auditorium was upgraded to accommodate modern stage productions and the new twice-monthly presentations by local and international artists established by the President's Committee on Culture. The university also prioritized publication, launching a number of scholarly journals, and began networking with other institutions nationally and abroad.\n\nAfter careful study of the technology program, the administration in 1992 decided to phase it out in favor of a computer technology program forged with the East Asia Computer Center, Inc. which offered degrees in computer science and certificate courses.\n\nIn 2010, FEU established the Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management and the FEU Makati campus, which started its operations by June of the same year. FEU Makati offer master's degree program in Business Administration and Baccalaureate programs in Accountancy, Accounting Technology, Information Technology and Business Administration.\n\nCorporate \nThe Far Eastern University, Incorporated () is a domestic non-sectarian educational institution founded in June 1928 and was registered and incorporated with the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 1933. On October 27, 1983, the university extended its corporate life to another 50 years. The university became a listed corporation in the PSE on July 11, 1986. It has been noted as the leading proprietary university in the Philippines.\n\nThe company operates through three segments: education, real estate and investment activities. Its geographical segments include Manila, Makati and Cavite.\n\nThe university's major subsidiaries include: Far Eastern College \u2013 Silang, Inc. (FECSI), East Asia Computer Center, Inc. (EACCI), Fern Realty Corporation (FRC), FEU Alabang, Inc. and FEU High School, Inc. Similar to the university, FECSI, EACCI, FEU Alabang, Inc. and FEU High School, Inc. were established to operate as educational institutions offering general courses of study. In April 2016, FEU entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire an initial 80% of Roosevelt College, Inc.\n\nIn 2019, FEU has entered into a joint venture with the Technological Institute of the Philippines to launch Edustria, a senior high school in Batangas.\n\nUniversity emblems\n\nThe university seal\n\nThe FEU Coat of Arms depicts a Sarimanok holding a kalasag. Inside the kalasag is an 8 pointed star with a bamboo scroll under it, inscribed with the baybayin letters \u201cKKK\u201d. Meanwhile, the university seal has the Coat of Arms housed inside a green ellipse with gold outline, surrounded with the university's name in baybayin-inspired font and the IABF's founding year at the bottom.\n\n The logo and font were designed by Galo Ocampo, the Father of Philippine Heraldry.\n FEU is one of the first universities in the country to be established by a Filipino. Thus, in 1961, the university wanted to showcase the Sarimanok-inspired coat of arms, as proposed by former Institute of Arts and Sciences Dean Alejando Roces; for it projects the nationalistic spirit upon which the university was founded. It also serves as the link between the past and present.\n The eight pointed star in the kalasag represents the 8 original institutes: Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, Institute of Education, Institute of Arts and Sciences, Institute of Technology, Institute of Law, Institute of Medicine, Institute of Nursing and Institute of Graduate Studies.\n The \"KKK\" inscription means Katotohanan (Truth), Kagandahan (Beauty), and Kabutihan (Goodness).\n\nThe university colors\n\nGreen and Gold are the university's official colors. Green is for hope, representing Rizal's \"Fair hope of the Fatherland\" while Gold represents the golden opportunity for the university to serve the youth and her alumni to serve the country.The university mascot\n\nThe tamaraw is the mascot of every FEU athletic team. Hence, it is the nickname of every FEU student (Tams). Known scientifically as \u201cBubalus mindorensis\u201d, it is a rare animal found only in the island of Mindoro. Symbolically enough, the tamaraw is one of the most intelligent, pugnacious and aggressive of our animal species just as the university is known for its advanced, progressive policy in contemporary education.\n\nThe university mace\n\nThe mace is the symbol of the office of the university president. It is used on every formal events.\n\nManila Campus\nFEU's campus is noted for a number of historical Art Deco buildings preserved from the first half of the 20th century. Among the buildings on FEU's campus complex, five by late Ar. Pablo S. Antonio Sr., garnered recognition in 2005 from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), who bestowed the Asia Pacific Heritage Award for Cultural Heritage on the university for \"the outstanding preservation of its Art Deco structures.\"The buildings include the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall, the Admissions Building, the Architecture and Fine Arts Building, the Administration Building, and the Science Building. The Cultural Center of the Philippines also recognized the historical legacy of the buildings with a marker. Other historical buildings on the campus include the 1950s FEU Chapel and the Arts Building, which represent the International Style.\n\nThe university maintains various facilities, such as an electronic library, various types of laboratories, an auditorium, audio-visual and multimedia rooms, technology-based gate security and enrollment system, and gymnasiums.\n\nDue to  FEU's mission to preserve and care for the environment, the university has a green and eco-friendly campus landscape and is famously called as the \"Oasis of the University Belt\".\n\nHistory \n\nDuring the 1930s, there was a heavy influence of American culture especially in the field of technology and construction that was reflected in the lives of the Filipinos. Concrete and steel were used by the Americans and was found to be the suitable materials for the tropical environment. These were materialized by Arch. Pablo S. Antonio Sr. in creating the FEU campus buildings that reflected both the university's and the country's vision and showed his personal transition from Art Deco to the International Style. The buildings were constructed between the years 1939 to 1950.\n\nHeritage Buildings of FEU Manila Campus \nNicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall The Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall, named after the founder of the FEU, is a long, low-rise U-shaped building facing Quezon Boulevard beside the Alfredo Reyes Hall. The building was constructed in 1939 by National Artist Arch. Pablo Antonio. The distinct character of the massive fa\u00e7ade are the sets of protruded vertical volumes located on both ends of the structure.\n\nAttention to details is another design focus of the architecture of Pablo S. Antonio Sr. The heavy influence of Art Deco in his architectural style is seen even in transitional elements like the stairs. The outdoor stairs that joins the walkway at the second floor has layers of thin concrete slabs that swirl in waves above the rigid geometry of the handrail.\n\nThe physical envelope of the building is one of the examples of classic Philippine Art Deco emphasizing the play on geometric forms.\n\nAdministration Building\n\nThe FEU Administration Building was also designed by Arch. Antonio Sr. a decade after the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall. It is located at the opposite end of the campus quadrangle that features a fa\u00e7ade with geometric architectural details, horizontal windows, and a balcony that extends into a viewing deck at the second floor to observe the activities in the quadrangle. The Administration lobby has floor tiles made of Carrara Marble, the same material used by Michelangelo in his mother and child sculpture La Pieta and also used in New York's Grand Central Station.\n\nIt houses the works of many known Filipino artists, most of them in the Art Deco era. One work is a mural done by Antonio Gonzales Dumlao, which conveys the university's mission; while Italian sculptor Francesco Ricardo Monti did a bas-relief on the lobby depicting the history of the Philippines. The Art Deco-inspired FEU Auditorium can be found inside the Administration Building.\n\nArchitecture and Fine Arts Building\n\nThe building is one of the twin edifices flanking the Administration Building. It is the third building designed by Arch. Antonio Sr., still in the Art Deco Style. Constructed in 1941, it used to house the Boys' High School, which was originally in the basic education program of the university. It also used to house the Law and Nursing programs before being handed to the IARFA.\nAdmissions Building Built in 1940, the Admissions Building is the mirror image of the Architecture & Fine Arts Building. The building was initially used by the Girls' High School, and in 1983, became home to the Institute of Medicine. In 2015, the building has been renovated and changed its name from FEU-East Asia College Building to the FEU Main Building, which was formerly used  by FEU-EAC students.\n\nScience Building The seven-story building erected in 1950 was the last designed building by Arch. Antonio Sr. in what is considered a transition of style between Art Deco and the post World War 2 International Style. In 1990, an earthquake caused structural damages to the building making it necessary to demolish the top two floors. By the late 2013, a sixth floor was added. The building now houses the Department of Medical Technology, Psychology, Biology and Mathematics.\n\nAuditorium \n\nFEU's Auditorium is designed by Pablo Antonio Sr., National Artist for Architecture, in 1949. It was regarded as the first \"Cultural Center of the Philippines\", and also, the very first fully air-conditioned auditorium in the country which can accommodate 1000 spectators.\nThe Auditorium was home to renowned orchestras. It featured dances from Manila Ballet Academy, New York City Center Ballet, and Martha Graham \u2013 an American dancer and one of the twentieth century revolutionary artists. It also became the venue of major theatrical productions like Bastien and Bastienne \u2013 created by two National Artists, Nick Joaquin (on words) and Cesar Legaspi (on scenic designs).In addition, it was in FEU where Sarah Joaquin\u2013actress, writer, director, and former Head of the Drama Department\u2013showcased her talents through presentation of classic and contemporary plays. To this date, the auditorium upholds this legacy by accommodating more notable performances from artists here and abroad.\n\nSCA Chapel \n\nAnother masterpiece is within campus is the Student Council Association (SCA) Chapel. Inaugurated on the 8th of December 1957, the SCA Chapel is where religious activities of faculty, personnel, and students are held. Its interior features a mural by Carlos \u201cBotong\u201d Francisco, proclaimed National Artist in 1973 and discoverer of Angono Petroglyphs (which is the oldest known work of art in the Philippines). His painting 14 Stations of the Cross encompasses 260 degrees of one's visual range. The SCA Chapel's fa\u00e7ade is the richly colored tile mosaic of Our Lady of Fatima by Vicente Manansala, also a National Artist who developed the transparent cubism technique apparent in this piece of art.\n\nNicanor B. Reyes Sr. Memorial Square \nIn the middle of the campus rests this landmark and favorite backdrop for picture-taking in the campus. Erected in commemoration of the university's 40th anniversary, it consists of a 65-foot flagpole on a platform surrounded on all sides with brass sculpture, also done by Manansala, which interprets the late founder's philosophy of education. It represents the professional disciplines offered by the university.\n\nFEU Library \n\nLocated on the second and third floors of the Nicanor Reyes Hall, the Library has a collection of books that falls under Circulation, Reserve, Reference, Filipiniana, and Periodical sections. These can easily be accessed using the Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) of FEU, its online database of all its print and multi-media resources. The Electronic Library is also available to provide members of the academic community highly effective learning experiences and services through the web and internet technologies as an extension of the services of the conventional library.\n\nThe Philippine Association of Academic Research Librarians, Inc. (PAARL) honored the library with the Outstanding Academic/Research Library Award during the PAARL 2012 Awards. The FEU library was recognized for its outstanding contribution to academic and research librarianship and library development along with leadership in regional library management, education and training, information and documentation services.\n\nAcademics \nFar Eastern University offers 24 undergraduate programs, 17 graduate degree programs, and a law school through its seven institutes, while the Institute of Technology offers 9 undergraduate programs leading to engineering and computer studies. The university offers secondary, post-secondary, and certification courses as well. Since 2020, FEU Manila holds extension programs in its Cavite campus \n\nThe university runs on a semestral academic system. An academic year starts in the second week of August and ends in May. The university is supervised by the Board of Trustees, which is made up of academic practitioners and specialists from various disciplines.\n\nStudents who wish to study in the university must pass the College Entrance Exam (FEUCAT). However, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, since SY 2020-2021, the FEUCAT is replaced by the FEU Student Placement for Admission to College Education (SPACE), wherein academic performance in Grades 11 and 12 are the basis for admissions.\n\nGrading system \nAn FEU student's final grade for a course generally comes in the form of a letter, which is a summary of their performance in the formative and summative assessments. A is given a value of 4, B+ 3.5, B 3, C+ 2.5, C 2, D+ 1.5, D 1, and F 0. The passing mark for all university courses regardless of program is 50%.\n\nScholarship Grants \nFEU funds an average of over 3,500 scholars every year, providing about 11% of the total student population. Scholarships are granted to academically qualified students, financially challenged yet deserving individuals, and university representatives in different fields of service and interests.\n\nRecognition and Accreditation \nConferred the Autonomous University status by Commission on Higher Education (CHED), FEU Manila currently meets the highest regulatory standards set for Philippine HEIs. CHED has designated FEU's Teacher Education Program and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration as Center of Excellence and Center of Development, respectively.\n\nFEU Manila has twenty-one accredited programs. In addition, eight of the undergraduate programs have level 4 \u2013 the highest \u2013 accreditation from the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA), while the rest are on their way to obtaining ever higher accreditation levels.\n\nFEU Manila's international recognitions include being an associate member of the ASEAN University Network \u2013 Quality Assurance (AUN-QA), one of less than ten Philippine HEIs with the distinction; a member of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) for its BS Accountancy, BS Business Administration, and Master of Business Administration programs; and an associate member of the International Centre of Excellence in Tourism and Hospitality Management (THE-ICE) for its BS Tourism Management and BS Hotel and Restaurant Management programs.

At its deepest point, the bay is 10 feet deep.\n\nAn aerial photo of Leggett Bay was featured in the Lake Oakland feature article contained in the July 2019 edition of Lakefront Lifestyles Magazine.\n\nHistory \n\nLeggets Lake (originally Leggett's Lake) was named for Mortimer Leggett (1837\u20131930) who came from New York and settled on a 140-acre farm in Clintonville, Michigan, next to the lake that would bear his family name.  The lake originally was separate from Lake Oakland and an effort to conjoin the two commenced in the late 1950s and concluded in 1960.  Now part of Lake Oakland, the body of water is referred to as Leggett Bay.

The lake's water is generally clear, with a visibility of up to 10 feet.\n\nGeology:\n\nThe lake is located in a glacial moraine, which was formed during the last ice age. The moraine is composed of rocks and soil that were transported by glaciers and deposited in the area. The lake's shoreline is mostly sandy, with some areas of rocky terrain.\n\nFlora and Fauna:\n\nLeggets Lake is home to a diverse range of plant and animal life. The lake is surrounded by a variety of trees, including oak, maple, and pine. The shoreline is also home to several species of aquatic plants, including water lilies and cattails.

Snowmobiling is also a popular activity, with several trails surrounding the lake that offer scenic views of the surrounding area.\n\nHistory:\n\nLeggets Lake has a rich history, dating back to the early 19th century. The lake was named after the Leggett family, who were early settlers in the area. The family operated a sawmill and a gristmill on the lake's shoreline, which were important to the local economy. The lake was also used as a source of ice, which was harvested during the winter months and stored in icehouses to be used throughout the year.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the lake became a popular destination for tourists, who came to enjoy the lake's scenic beauty and recreational opportunities. Several resorts and camps were established along the lake's shoreline, offering visitors a chance to stay and enjoy the area for extended periods.\n\nConservation Efforts:\n\nIn recent years, there have been several conservation efforts aimed at protecting Leggets Lake's ecosystem. The lake has been affected by several invasive species, including zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil. These species can harm native plants and animals, and can also affect the lake's water quality.\n\nTo combat these invasions, local authorities have implemented several measures, including the installation of boat launches and the creation of educational programs to raise awareness about the importance of protecting the lake's ecosystem. Additionally, efforts have been made to restore native vegetation and reduce the amount of nutrient runoff that enters the lake.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLeggets Lake is a unique and valuable resource, offering a variety of recreational and educational opportunities for visitors.

It was used from 1949 to 1975 by the Swiss Army and police units. It was also adopted and is still in service with the Military of Denmark (as M/49 Neuhausen or simply Neuhausen), in 1951 by the German Bundespolizei and in shooting sports.\n\nThe pistols were decommissioned by the Swiss Army and replaced by the SIG Sauer P220 (Swiss Army designation Pistole 75) developed in 1975. Swiss production of the P210 continued until 2006. A new model, the P210 Legend, was introduced by SIG Sauer GMBH of Germany in 2010, and another, the P210A, was introduced by SIG Sauer Inc. of New Hampshire in the United States in 2017.\n\nHistory\nThe design was derived from Charles Petter's Mod\u00e8le 1935A pistol. In 1937, Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) acquired a license for the Petter-Browning system from SACM in order to develop a replacement for the Luger Parabellum 06/29, which had been in service since 1900. Apparently not satisfied with the Petter Browning design or the changes they had made to it, SIG evaluated no fewer than 11 prototypes from 1942 through 1944. Selbstladepistole Neuhausen model 44/16 pistol production began in 1944. Some of the original Petter Browning features had been retained, specifically the self-contained firing and recoil systems.  The Neuhausen 44/16 had a magazine capacity of 16 rounds.\n\nDevelopment was slowed by the Second World War. After testing various experimental models (such as the aforementioned 44/16 with a double-column magazine), the 47/8 model was adopted in Oct 1948 as the Pistole Modell 1949 (P49), and SP47/8 for civilian market. Some previous series were tested by Swedish sport shooters and by the Danish army (Danish Defence designation Pistol M/1949). \n\nThe 47/8 model supported the easy change of the barrels between 7.65 and 9mm Parabellum and a kit to convert to .22 caliber (see table below).\n\nSIG M/1949 is the 47/8 model purchased for the Danish military and issued version for officers, military police, and special forces, chambered in 9mm Luger. \nUsually called only Neuhausen in Denmark, this model is stamped \"P m/49\", and also known as \"P210-DK\".\nFirst issued beginning in 1950 to the Danish Army Technical Corps (stamped \"HTK\"), this remained the standard sidearm in the Danish military throughout 60 years of continuous use, since the 2010s being replaced with the SIG Sauer P320 X-5 Carry.\n\nIn 1957, the civil designation (SP47/8) was definitively changed to P210 according to the company nomenclature policy. Model P210-1 in retrospect covers all models produced until 1965, the designation P210-2 refers to the standard model as produced from 1966 (beginning with serial nr.

P 6791 to P 6840 and P 8001 to P 8893), produced in limited numbers for the cantonal police forces of Basel, Lausanne, and Glarus, with a handful sold on the private market.\nP210-4 was the model made for the German border guard (serial nrs. D 1 to D 6500).\nP210-5 and P210-6 were civilian target shooting models made in the 1980s and 1990s.\nP210-7 was a rarely produced .22lr rimfire model, made in the 1950s and 1960s. \n\nSIG was renamed to SIG Sauer upon acquisition by Sauer & Sohn in the 1970s, and to Swiss Arms in 2000. \nSwiss Arms continued production of the P210 for private customers until 2006. \nFrom 2010, a new model, dubbed P210 Legend was made by SIG Sauer, GMBH of Eckernf\u00f6rde, Germany. This model was exported to the USA until 2017, when \nSIG Sauer Inc. of New Hampshire  began production of its own model, dubbed P210A, made in Exeter, N.H., offered in two versions, Standard (210A-9-B) and Target (210A-9-TGT).\n\nSerial numbers\nSerial numbers starting  A are the Swiss army ordnance models. \nArmy models run from serial number A 100001 to A 213110. Those that have a P added to the rear of a serial number that starts with an A have been sold by the Swiss army to civilians.  A stamped \"P\" (=\"privat\") on the front of the trigger guard shows that a weapon was left as a gift to the owner upon leaving the Armed Services.\n\nSerial numbers 6001 to 6028 are prototypes made during 1938\u20131947. 6033 to 6406 are early model SP47/8 made in 1947.\n\nSerial numbers with a P were made for police and for private use, running from  P 8001 to P 8250 (1951) and \nP 50004 (1949) to P 79150 (1975).  \nSerial numbers from P 79600 to P 97950  are private models made by SIG Sauer, Switzerland, during 1976\u20131984, and P 300001 to P 331536 were made by Sig Sauer (Swiss Arms) during 1983\u20132006; the jump to the 300000s range marks the transition from traditional forged frames to CNC production. \n\nDuring 1966\u20131969, SIG produced a small number of special heavy frame P210-5 models for the National Match team.\nThese are extremely rare, with a total of 46 pieces known in literature.\nIn the 1970s, these heavy frame models were commercialized and offered on the market, with \n100 pieces of P210-6 heavy frame pistols (P 76521 to P76620) made in 1979, \nand 50 pieces of  P210-6 heavy frame pistols, made for Hofmann & Reinhart of Z\u00fcrich (P 79101 to 79150).\nThese pistols represent the pinnacle of SIG pistol manufacture and are extremely sought after by collectors, and consequently almost never offered on the open market.\n  \nAnother special edition is numbered JP 1 to JP 500 (1978, \"125 Years of SIG\" anniversary edition).\nP 555001 to P 555555 are special collectors' edition of 555 sets of five chromed pistols with gilded controls, P210, P220, P225, P226 and P230, made for Vonbank AG in 1987 to 1990), at the time sold for CHF 12,950.\nIn 1991, another special edition numbered \u2116 0001 to \u2116 1991 was made to commemorate \"700 Years of Swiss Confederation\" (700 Jahre Eidgenossenschaft), at the time sold for CHF 4,100 per piece.\n\nSerial numbers starting with a D belong to the Bundesgrenzschutz issues  (D 1 to D 6500).\nThe Danish m/49 pistols have their own serial numbers, without a leading letter, engraved on the right side of the slide, running from 7695 (1951) to 35383 (1962).\nThe rare P210-7 .22lr calibre versions have numbers in the range 40501 (1957) to 41762 (1968).\n\nGallery\n\nUsers\n\n : used by the Danish Defense Force as m/49.\n : Used by the Presidential Security Service since 2007.\n : used by the Latvian National Guard.\n: used by the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince.\n : used by the Swiss Military and various police forces.\n\nReferences \n\n Armbruster, Erwin, & Werner Kessler (ed.).

It was first introduced in 1947 and was widely used by the Swiss military and police forces. The P210 is known for its accuracy, reliability, and durability, and has gained a reputation as one of the finest pistols in the world.\n\nDesign and Features\n\nThe SIG P210 is a recoil-operated, locked-breech pistol that chambered the 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge. It has a DA/SA (double-action/single-action) trigger system, which allows for both double-action and single-action firing. The double-action mode is used for the first shot, where the trigger is pulled to both cock the hammer and fire the weapon. The single-action mode is used for subsequent shots, where the hammer is already cocked and the trigger only needs to be pulled to fire the weapon.\n\nThe P210 has a 4-inch (100mm) barrel and an overall length of 7.8 inches (200mm). It has a steel frame and a wooden grip, which provides a comfortable and secure hold. The pistol is equipped with a rear-mounted safety lever that can be used to decock the weapon and prevent accidental discharges. It also has a loaded chamber indicator, which allows the user to see if there is a round already chambered.\n\nThe P210 has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds, and it can be loaded using a stripper clip or single rounds. The pistol is known for its accuracy, with a claimed accuracy of 1.5 inches (38mm) at 25 yards (23m).\n\nVariants\n\nThe SIG P210 has been produced in several variants over the years, including:\n\n* P210-1: The standard model with a black finish and wooden grips.\n* P210-2: A stainless steel version with a polished finish and wooden grips.\n* P210-3: A stainless steel version with a matte finish and rubber grips.\n* P210-4: A compact version with a 3.7-inch (94mm) barrel and an alloy frame.\n* P210-5: A target version with a 5-inch (127mm) barrel and adjustable sights.\n* P210-6: A stainless steel version with a 4-inch (100mm) barrel and a rounded trigger guard.\n\nService History\n\nThe SIG P210 has been used by the Swiss military and police forces since its introduction in 1947. It has also been adopted by several other countries, including Germany, Sweden, and Norway. The P210 has seen service in various conflicts, including the Vietnam War and the Gulf War.\n\nCivilians have also embraced the P210 for its accuracy, reliability, and durability. It has been popular among target shooters and collectors, and has been used in various competitions, including IPSC and IDPA.\n\nCultural Impact\n\nThe SIG P210 has had a significant impact on the firearms industry and popular culture. It has been featured in several films and TV shows, including James Bond movies and the TV series \"The Sopranos\". The P210 has also been used by several famous shooters, including the US Navy SEALs and the Swiss Army.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe SIG P210 is a highly respected pistol that has earned a reputation for its accuracy, reliability, and durability. Its service history and cultural impact have made it a legendary firearm that continues to be popular among collectors, target shooters, and enthusiasts.

She is most known for being the first coach and general manager for the Seattle Storm. She has more than 500 wins to her name.\n\nA native of Dresden, Tennessee, Dunn graduated from the University of Tennessee at Martin in 1969. She coached for decades in the college ranks, amassing a 447-257 record in 25 seasons as a college head coach. In her tenure at Austin Peay State University (1970\u20131976), the University of Mississippi (1977\u20131978), the University of Miami (1978\u20131987) and Purdue University (1987\u20131996), she made the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship seven times, and the Final Four once, in 1994 with Purdue. She is in the Athletics Hall of Fame at both Austin Peay and Miami. Dunn also was president of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association in 1984-85.\n\nDunn was abruptly fired at Purdue after the 1995-96 season, but resurfaced in the pros with the American Basketball League's Portland Power in 1996. She was ABL's coach of the year in 1998, right before that league folded. Dunn then became the first coach and GM of the expansion Seattle Storm in the ABL's rival, the WNBA. Her folksy southern personality was a hit in Urbane, Seattle, with fans often wearing Dunn masks and quoting her rustic aphorisms. The team started with a dismal 6-26 season.\n\nDunn left the Storm just as it was starting to have success. New superstars Lauren Jackson and Sue Bird led the team to the 2002 playoffs, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Sparks. Dunn then resigned, leaving the path open for Anne Donovan to build a championship team just two seasons later.\n\nDunn is a former head coach of the Indiana Fever. Dunn won the WNBA championship with the Fever on October 21, 2012.\n\nOn May 6, 2014, Dunn announced her retirement from coaching at the end of the year.\n\nOn June 14, 2014; Dunn was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nOn May 24, 2016, she was introduced as an assistant coach for Matthew Mitchell at Kentucky. On May 26, 2017, UK Athletics announced that Coach Dunn had signed a one-year contract extension.\n\nIn 2018, her role at Kentucky changed to special assistant to the head coach.\n\nUSA Basketball\n\nIn 1990, Dunn was the assistant coach for the USA National team at the World Championships in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The team, behind the 22 point per game scoring of Teresa Edwards, won all eight contests, with only the win over Cuba decided by single digits. The USA team faced Yugoslavia in the gold medal game, and won 88\u201378.\n\nIn 1995, Dunn served as the head coach to the R. William Jones Cup Team. The competition was held in Taipei, Taiwan. The USA team won its first six games, but four of the six were won by single-digit margins. Their seventh game was against Russia, and they fell 100\u201384. The final game was against South Korea, and a victory would assure the gold medal, but the South Korean team won 80\u201376 to win the gold medal.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Birlinn\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The birlinn () was a wooden vessel propelled by sail and oar, used extensively in the Hebrides and West Highlands of Scotland from the Middle Ages on. Variants of the name in English and Lowland Scots include \"berlin\" and \"birling\". The Gaelic term may derive from the Norse byr\u00f0ingr (ship of boards). It has been suggested that a local design lineage might also be traceable to vessels similar to the Broighter-type boat (first century BC), equipped with oars and a square sail, without the need to assume a specific Viking design influence. It is uncertain, however, whether the Broighter model represents a wooden vessel or a skin-covered boat of the currach type. The majority of scholars emphasise the Viking influence on the birlinn.\n\nThe birlinn was clinker-built and could be sailed or rowed. It had a single mast with a square sail. Smaller vessels of this type might have had as few as twelve oars, with the larger West Highland galley having as many as forty. For over four hundred years, down to the seventeenth century, the birlinn was the dominant vessel in the Hebrides.\n\nIn 1310, King Robert the Bruce granted Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray a reddendo or charter making him Lord of the Isle of Man in exchange for six birlinns of 26 oars. A 1615 report to the Scottish Privy Council made a distinction between galleys, having between 18 and 20 oars, and birlinns, with between 12 and 18 oars. There was no suggestion of structural differences. The report stated that there were three men per oar.\n\nThe birlinn appears in Scottish heraldry as the \"lymphad\", from the Scottish Gaelic long fhada.\n\nUse \nIn terms of design and function, there was considerable similarity between the local birlinn and the ships used by Norse incomers to the Isles. In an island environment ships were essential for the warfare which was endemic in the area, and local lords used the birlinn extensively from at least the thirteenth century. The strongest of the regional naval powers were the MacDonalds of Islay.\n\nThe Lords of the Isles of the Late Middle Ages maintained the largest fleet in the Hebrides. It is possible that vessels of the birlinn type were used in the 1156 sea battle in which Somerled, Lord of Argyll, the ancestor of the lords, firmly established himself in the Hebrides by confronting his brother-in-law, Godred Olafsson, King of the Isles.\n\nIn 1608 Andrew Stewart, Lord Ochiltree was sent by James VI of Scotland to quell feuds in the Western Isles. His orders included the destruction of shipping, named in his commissions as lymphads, galleys, and birlinns belonging to rebellious subjects.\n\nThough the surviving evidence has mostly to do with the birlinn in a naval context, there is independent evidence of mercantile activity for which such shipping would have been essential. There is some evidence for mercantile centres in Islay, Gigha, Kintyre and Knapdale, and in the fourteenth century there was constant trade between the Isles, Ireland and England under the patronage of local lords. Otherwise the chief uses of the birlinn would have been troop-carrying, fishing and cattle transport.\n\nConstruction and maintenance\nIn some ways the birlinn paralleled the more robust ocean-going craft of Norse design. Viking ships were double-ended, with a keel scarfed to stems fore and aft. A shell of thin planking (strake) was constructed on the basis of the keel, the planks being edge-joined and clenched with iron nails. Symmetrical ribs or frames were then lashed to the strakes or secured with trenails. Over most of the ribs was laid a slender crossbeam and a thwart. The mast was stepped amidships or nearly so, and oars, including a steering oar, were also used. The stem and stern post sometimes had carefully carved notches for plank ends, with knees securing the thwarts to the strakes and beams joining the heads of the frames.\n The hull bore a general resemblance to the Norse pattern, but stem and stern may have been more steeply pitched (though allowance must be paid for distortion in representation). Surviving images show a rudder. Nineteenth-century boat-building practices in the Highlands are likely to have applied also to the birlinn: examples are the use of dried moss, steeped in tar, for caulking, and the use of stocks in construction.\n\nOak was the wood favoured both in Western Scotland and in Scandinavia, being tough and resistant to decay. Other types of timber were less often used. It is likely that the Outer Isles of Western Scotland had always been short of timber, but birch, oak and pine abounded in the Inner Isles and on the mainland. The abundance of timber at Lochaber was proverbial: \"B'e sin fiodh a chur do Loch Abar\" (\"Bringing wood to Lochaber\") was said of any superfluous undertaking.\n\nThe tools used are likely to have included adzes, axes, augers and spoon bits, awls, planes, draw knives and moulding irons, together with other tools typical of the Northern European carpenter's kit. As in traditional shipbuilding, generally, measurements were largely by eye.\n\nThe traditional practice of sheltering boats in bank-cuttings (\"nausts\") \u2013 small artificial harbours \u2013 was probably also employed with the birlinn. There is evidence in fortified sites of constructed harbours, boat-landings and sea-gates.\n\nThe influence of Norse shipbuilding techniques, though plausible, is conjectural, since to date no substantial remnants of a birlinn have been found. Traditional boat-building techniques and terms, however, may furnish a guide as to the vessel's construction.\n\nRigging and sails \nCarved images of the birlinn from the sixteenth century and earlier show the typical rigging: braces, forestay and backstay, shrouds (fore and aft), halyard and a parrel (a movable loop used to secure a yard or gaff to a mast). There is a rudder with pintles on the leading edge, inserted into gudgeons. It is possible that use was made of a wooden bowline or reaching spar (called a beitass by the Norse). This was used to push the luff of the sail out into the wind.\n\nTraditional Highland practice was to make sails of tough, thick-threaded wool, with ropes being made of moss-fir or heather. Medieval sails, in the Highlands as elsewhere, are shown as being sewn out of many small squares, and there is possible evidence of reef points.\n\nAileach: a reconstruction\n\nA reproduction of a 16-oar Highland galley, the Aileach, was built in 1991 at Moville in Donegal. It was based on representations of such vessels in West Highland sculpture. Despite the good seagoing performance of the vessel, its design has been described as misleading because of an over-reliance in the plan on cramped sculptural images. The vessel was designed with a high, almost vertical, stern and stem. It proved difficult to fit in more than one rower per oar and the thwarts were too close together. Less constricted images from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries show vessels which are longer and larger.\n\nIreland \n\nThe Irish long fhada seems, from contemporary sources, to have resembled its West Highland equivalent, though there is as yet no archaeological confirmation.\n\nThe Annals of the Four Masters record the use of fleets in an Irish context, often with a Scottish connection. In 1413 Tuathal \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, returning from Ulster to Connacht with seven ships, encountered a severe storm (anfadh na mara) which drove them northwards to Scotland: only one of the ships survived. In 1433 Macdonald of the Isles arrived in Ulster with a large fleet (co c-cobhlach m\u00f3r) to assist the O'Neills in a war with the O'Donnells.\n\nIn Ireland oared vessels were employed extensively for warfare and piracy by the O'Malleys and the O'Flathertys, western lords whose base was in Connacht. English officials found it necessary to counter them with similar vessels. The most famous of these local rulers was Grace O'Malley, of whom Sir Richard Bingham reported in 1591 that she had twenty vessels at her command. She, like her father, was engaged in extensive seaborne trade.\n\nThere was constant maritime traffic between Ireland and Scotland, and Highland mercenaries were commonly transported by birlinn to Ireland.\n\nNaval technology \nThe birlinn, when rowed, was distinguished by its speed, and could often evade pursuers as a result. No cannon were mounted even in the later period: the birlinn was too lightly built and its freeboard was too low. It was highly suitable for raiding, however, and with experienced marksmen on board, could mount a formidable defence against small craft.\nVessels of this type were at their most vulnerable when beached or when cornered by a heavier vessel carrying cannon.\n\nPossible changes in design \n\nThere is some evidence that by the end of the sixteenth century new influences were affecting birlinn design. A carving made at Arasaig in 1641 shows a vessel with a lowered stem and stern. An English map of north-east Ireland made no later than 1603 shows \"fleetes of the Redshanks [Highlanders] of Cantyre\" with vessels one-masted as before but with a square sail mounted on a sloping yard arm and a small cabin at the stern projecting backwards. Two Clanranald seals attached to documents dated 1572 show a birlinn with raised decks at stem and stern, a motif repeated in later heraldic devices. If such changes occurred, they would reflect influences from the south-east and ultimately from the Mediterranean. The supporting evidence has been criticised for being slight and unconvincing, but there is pictorial evidence for similar developments in the Irish galley.\n\nSee also\nIrish galley\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n Caldwell, David H.

Sections of the libraries were restored and expanded in the 16th and 17th centuries, including the addition of a second storey, an east wing and a west wing. The library currently functions as an additional reading room for the Bodleian Library.\n\nHistory\n\nDuke Humfrey's Library is named after Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester, a younger son of Henry IV of England. He was a connoisseur of literature and commissioned translations of classical works from Greek into Latin. When he died in 1447, he donated his collection of 281 books to the University of Oxford. At the time, this was considered an incredibly generous donation as the university only had 20 books. All classes at that time were taught via oral lectures; books were handwritten and were only for the extremely wealthy. \n\nThe library was constructed as a second storey to the Divinity School between 1450 and 1480 in order to house the donated collection. In 1550, during the Reformation, the King's Commissioners despoiled the library of books in order to destroy the vestiges of Roman Catholicism in the country. The books were probably burnt, and in 1556 the furniture was removed by the university. Today, only three of Humfrey's original books remain in the library.\n\nThe Library was refitted and restored from 1598 by Sir Thomas Bodley and between 1610 and 1612, the east wing (now the Arts End) was added. The west wing (now the Selden End) was built 20 years later. The books in the oldest part are accommodated in oak bookcases which are at right angles to the walls on either side with integral readers' desks. The ceiling consists of panels painted with the arms of the university. Up until the opening of the new Weston Library in 2015, Duke Humfrey's Library functioned as a reading room for maps, music and pre-1641 rare books; it now serves as an additional reading room for users of the Bodleian Library.\n\nCollections \nServing as an additional reading room for all users of the Bodleian, the Library consists of the original medieval section (1487), the Arts End (1612), and the Selden End (1637). It houses collections of maps, music, Western manuscripts, and theology and art materials. It is the main reading room for researchers of codicology, bibliography and local history, as well as it containing the University Archives and the Conservative Party Archive.\n\nThe Library is on the first floor and forms an H-shape with the later parts as the uprights. The Arts End is above the Proscholium and is attached at two corners to the Old Schools Quadrangle. The medieval section is above the Divinity School and Selden End (named after John Selden a benefactor of the library) is above the Convocation House. \n\nA drawing of the medieval section with the Divinity School below in isolation is used as the emblem of the Bodleian Library. \n\nDuke Humfrey's Library was used as the Hogwarts Library in the Harry Potter films.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nBodleian Library", "machine_text": " Duke Humfrey's Library is a historic library located within the University of Oxford's Bodleian Library in Oxford, England.

It is a follow up to 2013's Hubardo. It's the first album from Kayo Dot to not be self-released since 2012's Gamma Knife. Coffins on Io marks a notable change in sound. It combines influences of Type O Negative, The Sisters of Mercy, Peter Gabriel, dark wave and other 80s electronic musicians. It combines aspects of electronic music, jazz fusion, post-punk, gothic rock and new wave.  It was produced by Toby Driver.\n\nWriting and recording\nAfter releasing an album on The Flenser for one of Driver's other bands, Vaura, Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the Kayo Dot moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010. The album began as a four-song experiment, and was transformed into a full-length album. Continuing the theme of the last album, the album was recorded by the full live band.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDriver has said that the album was influenced by dark wave as well as Type O Negative, Peter Gabriel and other similar electronic bands of the 1980s.  Driver said in an interview that the album was heavily influenced by dark wave and was written as evoking \"1980s retrofuture noir.\"\n\nDriver's insistence that the album stay away from the influence of Hubardo resulted in an album that sounds drastically different from prior Kayo Dot albums. There are no growled vocals, and the album is not metal like many of the prior albums. In addition, this album relies heavily on repetition and melody, something prior Kayo Dot albums have strayed away from. Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically Blade Runner.\n\nRelease and reception\nThe album was released on October 15 through The Flenser. It is available for purchase on The Flenser's site and Kayo Dot's bandcamp in MP3, FLAC, CD and LP. The album has received positive reviews, many praising the band's shift in music direction. Empty Lighthouse called it \"Kayo Dot's best album to date\" and celebrates its ability to \"nail the noir feel,\" describing the album as \"Lynchian\". Re-views Media writer Michael Snoxall gave the album four stars out of five, saying the album feels familiar yet alien at the same time, and that the album is a \"monumental\" and \"towering achievement.\" SputnikMusic gave it a 4/5, saying it \"hums with sleek resonance\" and calling the album \"vibrant and exciting.\"\n\nTrack listing\nMusic by Toby Driver.

Amidst this barren, hostile landscape, a strange and macabre sight can be found - coffins. Yes, you read that right, coffins, on a moon of Jupiter.\n\nThese coffins are not the resting places of alien beings or the remains of an ancient civilization. They are, in fact, the final resting places of human beings, who have been buried on Io's surface. But how did they get here? And why would anyone choose to be buried on a moon of Jupiter?\n\nThe answer lies in the unique properties of Io's surface. The moon's intense volcanic activity creates a constant supply of molten lava, which solidifies on the surface, creating a landscape of black rock. This rock is rich in silicates, which are ideal for preserving human remains. In fact, the conditions on Io are so ideal that the bodies buried here are perfectly preserved, down to the smallest detail.\n\nThe practice of burying humans on Io began as a means of honoring the dead. In the distant future, when humanity had colonized the stars and began to explore the galaxy, the discovery of Io's unique properties led to the establishment of a cemetery on the moon's surface. The first burials were those of astronauts who had lost their lives in the exploration of space.\n\nOver time, the cemetery on Io became a place of pilgrimage for those who sought to honor their loved ones and pay their respects to the dead. It became a tradition for families to have their loved ones buried on Io, as a means of ensuring their remembrance and commemoration.\n\nBut the practice of burying humans on Io is not without controversy. Some argue that the use of a celestial body as a cemetery is disrespectful to the dead and disruptive to the natural environment. Others see it as a violation of the moon's sovereignty and a desecration of a sacred place.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the coffins on Io remain a popular destination for those seeking to pay their respects to the dead. The site has become a symbol of humanity's exploration of space and its desire to transcend the limitations of mortality.\n\nIn conclusion, the coffins on Io are a macabre yet fascinating sight, a testament to humanity's ingenuity and its ability to find meaning in the most unexpected of places. Whether seen as a respectful tribute to the dead or a violation of a celestial body, the coffins on Io serve as a reminder of our enduring connection to the cosmos and our desire to leave a lasting legacy in the vast expanse of space.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43660582}

Produced by Greg Fidelman, it was released as the fourth single from the band's sixth studio album We Are Not Your Kind on December 16, 2019.\n\nBackground  \n\"Nero Forte\" was released on December 16, 2019 as the band's fourth single off their sixth studio album We Are Not Your Kind, following after the release of \"Birth of the Cruel\" four months previously. The song's title \"Nero\" and \"Forte\" are Italian words that mean \"black\" and \"strong\" respectively. \"Forte\" can also mean something in which you excel.\n\nRecording and meaning  \nThough the song title does not appear in the lyrics, it describes the darkness that Taylor sunk into. The depression was like an entity that he did not feel he had the strength to fight against. When talking about the song, guitarist\u00a0Jim Root stated: \"This is also a\u00a0Clown song, which is amazing. This one is going to be great live. It's very percussive and reminiscent of\u00a0\"Psychosocial\", but maybe an evolution of \"Psychosocial\". Obviously, Clown is a drummer and percussionist, but he's also a songwriter\u2014and he always has been. Now we're able to collaborate as songwriters, and this is what we end up with. When Corey came in and started diving into the vocals, he came up with this extra melody in the chorus line, very late into the process. That really drew me into this song.\"\n\nMusic video  \nShawn Crahan, Slipknot's percussionist and founder, directed the video along with a 20 minute short film titled Pollution, which would be released on the same day as the \"Nero Forte\". They were both recorded within two days, on both the 29th and 30 October. They were both initially to be released at some point during November, but for some reasons they did not come into fruition until a later date.\n\nThe \"Nero Forte\" music video stars the band, who jam out and perform in a white limbo, constantly flashed by coloured beaming lights, at points surrounding what seems to be a fan inside of a cocoon, which has something inside which appears to try to be trying to escape and be reborn.\n\nAs of December 2021, the song has 40 million views on YouTube.\n\nCharts\n\nReferences \n\nSongs written by Corey Taylor\nSongs written by Jim Root\nSongs written by Shawn Crahan\n2019 songs\n2019 singles\nSlipknot (band) songs\nRoadrunner Records singles", "machine_text": " Nero Forte is a popular Italian folk dance that originated in the region of Campania, specifically in the city of Naples. The dance is characterized by its fast-paced, energetic movements, which are often performed to the sound of traditional Neapolitan music.\n\nThe origins of Nero Forte can be traced back to the 18th century, when it was first performed by the working class in the streets of Naples. The dance was originally known as the \"Tarantella,\" and it was characterized by its fast-paced steps and lively rhythm. Over time, the dance evolved and became known as Nero Forte, which roughly translates to \"strong black\" in Italian.\n\nNero Forte is typically performed by a couple, who dance together in a syncopated rhythm. The dance begins with a series of rapid footwork patterns, which are accompanied by the sound of castanets and tambourines. As the dance progresses, the movements become more complex and intricate, with the couple executing a series of spins, kicks, and leaps.\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of Nero Forte is its use of shoulder shimmies and hip movements. The woman dancer will often use her shoulders and hips to sway to the rhythm of the music, while the man dancer will use his hips and legs to execute a series of powerful kicks and leaps. The dance is also characterized by its use of hand clapping and foot stomping, which add to its lively and energetic atmosphere.\n\nNero Forte has become an important part of Neapolitan culture and is often performed during festivals and celebrations. The dance has also gained popularity beyond Italy, with dance groups and performers from around the world incorporating Nero Forte into their performances.\n\nIn recent years, Nero Forte has experienced a resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to its inclusion in popular films and television shows. The dance has been featured in films such as \"The Great Beauty\" and \"Gomorrah,\" as well as in television shows like \"The Originals\" and \"Dance Moms.\"\n\nOverall, Nero Forte is a lively and energetic dance that has become an important part of Italian culture and tradition. Its fast-paced movements and lively rhythm have made it a favorite among dance enthusiasts and performers around the world. Whether performed in its traditional form or adapted for modern audiences, Nero Forte continues to captivate audiences with its beauty and energy.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 60780398}

Zambrano, a 35-year-old man originally from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, was shot and killed by three police officers after allegedly throwing rocks at cars and police officers. His hands were in the air when the police fired the shots. Police officers said one of the rocks was as large as a softball. A toxicology report conducted by police found Zambrano's blood tested positive for methamphetamine.\n\nZambrano-Montes' family initially filed a $4.8 million claim against the city of Pasco for the shooting, which they called an \"execution\", saying he \"did not represent a threat of grievous bodily harm to anyone\" at the time of his death. Two of the officers involved in the shooting were white, and one was Hispanic. The killing led to criticism by the Mexican government. with the country's President, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, condemning the officers' \"disproportionate use of lethal force.\"\n\nBackground\nZambrano-Montes was raised in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, the third of sixteen children born to Jes\u00fas Montes and Agapita Montes-Rivera. In 2004, he immigrated to the United States to work in the orchards. He was married with two daughters. His wife had previously obtained a protection order against him alleging abuse. Zambrano-Montes was in the country illegally and did not speak English. He was arrested for assaulting a police officer in January 2014. The police stated that he had tried to grab an officer's pistol in the officer's holster as well as throwing objects at the officers and trying to strike them with a mailbox. He pleaded guilty in June 2014. Prior to the incident, he had spent some time in a homeless shelter and was \"struggling emotionally\" after being unable to work after an injury. According to police reports, the officers first tried to subdue him with voice commands and then with a Taser.\n\nShooting\nThree officers\u2014Ryan Flanagan, Adam Wright and Adrian Alaniz\u2014fired on Zambrano-Montes. Flanagan and Wright are white, and Alaniz is Hispanic. None of them were wearing body cameras. The shooting was caught on video by a civilian who recorded the incident from about 50 feet away showing Zambrano-Montes was running away from police, either with a rock in his hand or unarmed, and turned to face the officers before he was shot by them. Several weeks prior to the shooting, one of the officers, Adam Wright, had dragged Zambrano-Montes away from his burning rental home.\n\nAftermath\nThe death of Zambrano-Montes led to criticism by the Mexican government with Mexico's Congress calling the shooting an \"act that outrages all Mexicans\" and the country's President, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, condemning the officers' \"disproportionate use of lethal force.\" There were also mass protests in Pasco, with many protesters attending from outside the local community. The Tri-City Herald reported that \"turmoil continued in Pasco nearly two weeks after the controversial shooting of Antonio Zambrano-Montes,\" as protests are not typically of this size in this town. A small ongoing presence of activists was present at the Pasco City Hall.\n\nThe three officers involved in the shooting were placed on paid administrative leave. As of February 16, \"a multiagency investigation was underway\". A local group, Consejo Latino, called for an additional investigation by the United States Department of Justice.  There are 68 officers on the police force in Pasco, of whom 14 (21%) are Hispanic. Pasco is 56% Hispanic.\n\nOn February 26, a report indicated \"The U.S. Attorney's office for Eastern Washington ... [had joined] the FBI in keeping track of the investigation.\"\n\nAs of February 27, 2015, reports indicated that seventeen shots had been fired; there were conflicting reports regarding as to whether autopsy results indicated the victim had been shot in the back. The medical examiner's analysis was expected to be complete in about a month's time; transcripts of witness statements were not expected to be available for several weeks. Zambrano-Montes's family commissioned a third autopsy conducted by forensic pathologist Werner Spitz. A federal mediator from the US Justice Department was dispatched in late March to help to mediate talks between the Pasco police department and local community groups who believe the shooting was unjustified while Zambrano-Montes' widow has called for the three officers to be charged with murder. A request to Governor Jay Inslee by Latino advocacy group Consejo Latino to remove Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant  from the investigation was refused, on the basis that prosecutors were obligated to fully investigate and prosecute crimes absent \"very specific, tangible, and compelling reasons.\"\n\nShawn Sant\u2014along with Michael C. Ormsby, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington\u2014declined to file charges against the three officers, stating that the officers acted in good faith and without malice. Ryan Flanagan left the police department in July 2015 while on administrative leave. The other two officers, Adam Wright and Adrian Alaniz, eventually returned to duty.\n\nCivil lawsuit\nIn 2015, the family of Zambrano filed a $25 million claim in federal court against the city of Pasco claiming excessive force led to his death. The family hired civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida and the family of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; and Jose Baez, who represented Casey Anthony. The family later accepted a $700,000 settlement which was divided among Zambrano's two daughters, parents and widow.\n\nReferences\n\n2015 in Washington (state)\nDeaths by firearm in Washington (state)\nLatino people shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States\nProtests in the United States\nFilmed killings by law enforcement\nCriminal rock-throwing", "machine_text": " Killing of Antonio Zambrano-Montes\n\nOn February 10, 2015, Antonio Zambrano-Montes, a 35-year-old Mexican immigrant, was shot and killed by three police officers in Pasco, Washington, United States.

The incident served as a catalyst for change, and it reminded the community of the importance of holding law enforcement accountable for their actions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe killing of Antonio Zambrano-Montes was a tragedy that sparked widespread outrage and protests.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mineral, Washington murders\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mineral, Washington murders, dubbed by the media as \"the Tube Sock Killings,\" is a series of unsolved murders that occurred in remote areas of Lewis and Pierce County, Washington, near the remote community of Mineral, Washington, in 1985. The murder cases were widely publicized, and were featured on the television series Unsolved Mysteries in 1989.\n\nCase\n\nHarkins and Cooper\nOn August 10, 1985, Steven Harkins, 27, and his girlfriend, Ruth Cooper, 42, left their Tacoma, Washington home for a weekend camping trip at Tule Lake in Pierce County. When the two did not return to their jobs at a Tacoma vocational school the following Monday, their families reported them missing. Four days later, on August 14, hikers passing through Pierce County found Harkins' body near a remote campsite. He had been shot in the head, and his body, still in a sleeping bag, suggested he had been murdered while sleeping. Nearby, searchers also found Harkins' and Cooper's pet dog, who had been shot to death as well. At the time, law enforcement suspected that the case may have been connected to the murders of Edward Smith and Kimberly Diane La Vine, a couple from Kent, Washington who were abducted, murdered, and disposed of in a gravel pit near the Columbia River in March 1985.\n\nOn October 26, a skull was found at the dead end of Eighth Avenue South, near Harts Lake, about   from where Harkins' body was found. Dental records confirmed the skull belonged to Cooper, and two days later on October 28, her body and her purse were also recovered from the area,  from where her skull had been found. A tube sock had been tied around Cooper's neck. According to the autopsy, Cooper had died of \"homicidal violence,\" though a spokesman later stated she had died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. After the discovery of Cooper, the murders were publicized by Crime Stoppers in an attempt to recover information leading to the arrest of those responsible.\n\nRiemer and Robertson\n\nOver a month after the discovery of Ruth Cooper, on December 12, 1985, Mike Riemer, 36, his girlfriend, Diana Robertson, 21, and their daughter, Crystal Louise Robertson, age 2, traveled from their Tacoma home to Pierce County, planning to find a camp site near the Nisqually River. Riemer, an animal trapper, also planned to check on traps he had set in the area. Later that evening, customers at a Kmart store  north in Spanaway found the couple's daughter, Crystal, standing outside the store entrance. Crystal was placed in temporary foster care until her maternal grandmother saw her photograph on a local news broadcast two days later. When asked where her mother was, the dazed two-year-old told her grandmother that her \"Mommy was in the trees.\" According to investigators, the two-year-old was \"not nearly verbal enough\" to provide any information.\n\nPolice searched the area both on foot and by air, looking for evidence of Riemer's red 1982 Plymouth pickup truck, but efforts remained fruitless. On February 18, 1986, over two months after the couple's disappearance, the body of Diana Robertson was discovered half-buried in snow by a motorist near a logging road off of Washington State Route 7 in Mineral. Bloodhounds scoured the area in the following days, but  of snowfall impeded the search. Riemer's pickup truck was also found near Robertson's body.\n\nIn the truck, police discovered a note on the dashboard that read \"I love you, Diana.\" It was written on a manila envelope. Robertson's mother claimed the handwriting was that of Riemer. Bloodstains were also found on the seat of the truck. An autopsy revealed that Diana Robertson had been stabbed seventeen times, and, as with Ruth Cooper, was also found with a tube sock tied around her neck.\n\nDue to Riemer's disappearance, investigators believed he may have been responsible for Robertson's murder, and had abandoned his daughter at the Kmart store and then subsequently fled. Police theorized that Riemer may have been responsible for Harkins' and Cooper's murders as well; an alternate theory, however, claimed that Riemer was also a victim of the same killer who had murdered Robertson, Harkins, and Cooper.\n\nIn February 1986, after the discovery of Robertson's body, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published an article revealing that Riemer had been charged with domestic assault against Robertson on October 19, 1985. However, the couple had reconciled by December, the month in which they disappeared. Riemer, who worked as a roofer at Seattle\u2019s Queen City Sheet Metal and Roofing Inc., was described by his employer as a \"typical roofer who worked hard and played hard.\"\n\n2011 development\nOn March 26, 2011, hikers discovered a partial human skull later determined to be that of Mike Riemer. It was found in an area within a mile radius of where Robertson's body had been discovered in 1986. After recovery of the skull, Lewis County investigators stated that they believed Riemer could have been a possible victim of homicide as well, though his cause of death could not be determined. Based on the condition of the skull, however, authorities were able to rule out a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nMedia depiction\nIn September 1989, the case was featured by the series Unsolved Mysteries.\n\nSee also\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\nList of serial killers in the United States\nList of solved missing person cases\nList of unsolved murders\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAudio segment on The Trail Went Cold podcast\nCase profile at unsolved.com\nMichael Lloyd Riemer at Find a Grave\nDiana Robertson at Find a Grave\n\n1980s missing person cases\n1985 in Washington (state)\n1985 murders in the United States\nAugust 1985 events in the United States\nDecember 1985 events in the United States\nAugust 1985 crimes\nDecember 1985 crimes\nAmerican murder victims\nCouples\nCrimes in Washington (state)\nDeaths by firearm in Washington (state)\nDeaths by stabbing in the United States\nFormerly missing people\nFugitives\nMissing person cases in Washington (state)\nMurder in Washington (state)\nPeople murdered in Washington (state)\nSerial murders in the United States\nUnidentified serial killers\nUnsolved murders in the United States", "machine_text": " Mineral, Washington Murders\n\nMineral is a small town located in Lewis County, Washington, with a population of approximately 200 residents.

The investigation into her murder was led by the Lewis County Sheriff's Office, with assistance from the Washington State Patrol and the FBI.\n\nThe second murder took place on February 12, 2019, when 45-year-old John Smith was found dead in his vehicle, which had been parked outside a local convenience store. John was a long-time resident of Mineral and owned a small business in the town. The autopsy revealed that he had died from a single gunshot wound to the head. The investigation into his murder was also led by the Lewis County Sheriff's Office, with assistance from the Washington State Patrol and the FBI.\n\nThe third murder occurred on March 15, 2019, when 27-year-old Emily Johnson was found dead in a local park. Emily was a recent college graduate who had returned to Mineral to work as a nurse at the local hospital. Her body was discovered by a group of hikers, who reported that she had been shot once in the chest. The investigation into her murder was led by the Lewis County Sheriff's Office, with assistance from the Washington State Patrol and the FBI.\n\nThe Mineral Murders, as they came to be known, sent shockwaves through the community and the entire nation. The town was in a state of panic, with residents fearing for their safety and the safety of their loved ones. The authorities increased patrols in the area and conducted door-to-door searches, but no suspect was found.\n\nThe investigation into the murders was a complex and challenging one, with few leads and no clear motive. The authorities were baffled by the fact that all three victims were seemingly unrelated, with no connection to each other or to any known criminal activity. The community came together to support the families of the victims, with local businesses and residents organizing fundraisers and memorial services.\n\nAs the investigation continued, the authorities received several tips and leads, but none of them led to the identification of a suspect. The case remained unsolved for several months, until a breakthrough in the investigation in August 2019. A local resident came forward and reported seeing a suspicious person in the area where Emily Johnson's body was found. The description of the suspect matched a man named Michael Davis, who was arrested and charged with the murders.\n\nMichael Davis, a 32-year-old former convict, was arrested and charged with the murders of Sarah Williams, John Smith, and Emily Johnson. According to the authorities, Davis had a history of violent behavior and had been living in Mineral at the time of the murders. The investigation revealed that he had a fascination with firearms and had been seen in the area where the murders took place. The community was relieved that a suspect had been caught, but the memory of the Mineral Murders would continue to haunt the town for years to come.\n\nIn conclusion, the Mineral, Washington murders were a series of brutal and senseless killings that shocked the community and the entire nation. The investigation into the murders was a complex and challenging one, but the authorities were eventually able to identify and charge a suspect. The case serves as a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of community support in times of crisis.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 49293155}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Automatic bug fixing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Automatic bug-fixing is the automatic repair of software bugs without the intervention of a human programmer. It is also commonly referred to as automatic patch generation, automatic bug repair, or automatic program repair. The typical goal of such techniques is to automatically generate correct patches to eliminate bugs in software programs without causing software regression.\n\nSpecification \n\nAutomatic bug fixing is made according to a specification of the expected behavior which can be for instance a formal specification or a test suite.\n\nA test-suite \u2013 the input/output pairs specify the functionality of the program, possibly captured in assertions can be used as a test oracle to drive the search. This oracle can in fact be divided between the bug oracle that exposes the faulty behavior, and the regression oracle, which encapsulates the functionality any program repair method must preserve. Note that a test suite is typically incomplete and does not cover all possible cases. Therefore, it is often possible for a validated patch to produce expected outputs for all inputs in the test suite but incorrect outputs for other inputs. The existence of such validated but incorrect patches is a major challenge for generate-and-validate techniques. Recent successful automatic bug-fixing techniques often rely on additional information other than the test suite, such as information learned from previous human patches, to further identify correct patches among validated patches.\n\nAnother way to specify the expected behavior is to use formal specifications Verification against full specifications that specify the whole program behavior including functionalities is less common because such specifications are typically not available in practice and the computation cost of such verification is prohibitive. For specific classes of errors, however, implicit partial specifications are often available. For example, there are targeted bug-fixing techniques validating that the patched program can no longer trigger overflow errors in the same execution path.\n\nTechniques\n\nGenerate-and-validate \n\nGenerate-and-validate approaches compile and test each candidate patch to collect all validated patches that produce expected outputs for all inputs in the test suite. Such a technique typically starts with a test suite of the program, i.e., a set of test cases, at least one of which exposes the bug. An early generate-and-validate bug-fixing systems is GenProg. The effectiveness of generate-and-validate techniques remains controversial, because they typically do not provide patch correctness guarantees. Nevertheless, the reported results of recent state-of-the-art techniques are generally promising. For example, on systematically collected 69 real world bugs in eight large C software programs, the state-of-the-art bug-fixing system Prophet generates correct patches for 18 out of the 69 bugs.\n\nOne way to generate candidate patches is to apply mutation operators on the original program. Mutation operators manipulate the original program, potentially via its abstract syntax tree representation, or a more coarse-grained representation such as operating at the statement-level or block-level. Earlier genetic improvement approaches operate at the statement level and carry out simple delete/replace operations such as deleting an existing statement or replacing an existing statement with another statement in the same source file. Recent  approaches use more fine-grained operators at the abstract syntax tree level to generate more diverse set of candidate patches.\n\nAnother way to generate candidate patches consists of using fix templates. Fix templates are typically predefined changes for fixing specific classes of bugs. Examples of fix templates include inserting a conditional statement to check whether the value of a variable is null to fix null pointer exception, or changing an integer constant by one to fix off-by-one errors. It is also possible to automatically mine fix templates for generate-and-validate approaches.\n\nMany generate-and-validate techniques rely on the redundancy insight: the code of the patch can be found elsewhere in the application. This idea was introduced in the Genprog system, where two operators, addition and replacement of AST nodes, were based on code taken from elsewhere (i.e. adding an existing AST node). This idea has been validated empirically, with two independent studies that have shown that a significant proportion of commits (3%-17%) are composed of existing code. Beyond the fact that the code to reuse exists somewhere else, it has also been shown that the context of the potential repair ingredients is useful: often, the donor context is similar to the recipient context.\n\nSynthesis-based \n\nRepair techniques exist that are based on symbolic execution. For example, Semfix uses symbolic execution to extract a repair constraint. Angelix introduced the concept of angelic forest in order to deal with multiline patches.\n\nUnder certain assumptions, it is possible to state the repair problem as a synthesis problem.\nSemFix and Nopol uses component-based synthesis.\nDynamoth  uses dynamic synthesis.\nS3 is based on syntax-guided synthesis.\nSearchRepair converts potential patches into an SMT formula and queries candidate patches that allow the patched program to pass all supplied test cases.\n\nData-driven \n\nMachine learning techniques can improve the effectiveness of automatic bug-fixing systems. One example of such techniques learns from past successful patches from human developers collected from open source repositories in GitHub and SourceForge. It then use the learned information to recognize and prioritize potentially correct patches among all generated candidate patches. Alternatively, patches can be directly mined from existing sources. Example approaches include mining patches from donor applications or from QA web sites. Learning can done online, aka continual learning, with the known precedent of online learning of patches from the stream of open source build results from continuous integration.\n\nSequenceR uses sequence-to-sequence learning on source code in order to generate one-line patches. It defines a neural network architecture that works well with source code, with the copy mechanism that allows to produce patches with tokens that are not in the learned vocabulary. Those tokens are taken from the code of the Java class under repair.\n\nGetafix is a language-agnostic approach developed and used in production at Facebook. Given a sample of code commits where engineers fixed a certain kind of bug, it learns human-like fix patterns that apply to future bugs of the same kind. Besides using Facebook's own code repositories as training data, Getafix learnt some fixes from open source Java repositories. When new bugs get detected, Getafix applies its previously learnt patterns to produce candidate fixes and ranks them within seconds. It presents only the top-ranked fix for final validation by tools or an engineer, in order to save resources and ideally be so fast that no human time was spent on fixing the same bug, yet.\n\nOther \nTargeted automatic bug-fixing techniques generate repairs for specific classes of errors such as null pointer exception integer overflow , buffer overflow , memory leak ,  etc.. Such techniques often use empirical fix templates to fix bugs in the targeted scope. For example, insert a conditional statement to check whether the value of a variable is null or insert missing memory deallocation statements. Comparing to generate-and-validate techniques, targeted techniques tend to have better bug-fixing accuracy but a much narrowed scope.\n\nUse \n\nThere are multiple uses of automatic bug fixing:\n In a development environment: When encountering a bug the developer activates a feature to search for a patch (for instance by clicking on a button). This search can also happen in the background, when the IDE proactively searches for solutions to potential problems, without waiting for explicit action from the developer. \n In a continuous integration server: When a build fails during continuous integration, a patch search can be attempted as soon as the build has failed. If the search is successful, the patch is provided to the developer. When a synthesized patch is suggested to the developers as pull-request, an explanation has to be provided in addition to the code changes (e.g. a pull request title and description). An experiment has shown that generated patches can be accepted by open-source developers and merged in the code repository.\n At runtime: When a failure happens at runtime, a binary patch can be searched for and applied online. An example of such a repair system is ClearView, which does repair on x86 code, with x86 binary patches. The Itzal system is different from Clearview: while the repair search happens at runtime, in production, the produced patches are at the source code level. The BikiniProxy system does online repair of JavaScript errors happening in the browser.\n\nSearch space \n\nIn essence, automatic bug fixing is a search activity, whether deductive-based or heuristic-based. The search space of automatic bug fixing is composed of all edits that can be possibly made to a program. There have been studies to understand the structure of this search space. Qi et al. showed that the original fitness function of Genprog is not better than random search to drive the search. Martinez et al. explored the imbalance between possible repair actions, showing its significant impact on the search. Long et al.'s study indicated that correct patches can be considered as sparse in the search space and that incorrect overfitting patches are vastly more abundant (see also discussion about overfitting below).\n\nIf one explicitly enumerates all possible variants in a repair algorithm, this defines a design space for program repair. Each variant selects an algorithm involved at some point in the repair process (e.g. the fault localization algorithm), or selects a specific heuristic which yields different patches. For instance, in the design space of generate-and-validate program repair, there is one variation point about the granularity of the program elements to be modified: an expression, a statement, a block, etc.\n\nIt is also possible to analyze whether known search spaces encompass existing commits. Such a search space analysis means mining a software repository, this results in an approximation of the applicability and usefulness of a given repair algorithm.\n\nOverfitting \n\nSometimes, in test-suite based program repair, tools generate patches that pass the test suite, yet are actually incorrect, this is known as the \"overfitting\" problem. \"Overfitting\" in this context refers to the fact that the patch overfits to the test inputs. There are different kinds of overfitting: incomplete fixing means that only some buggy inputs are fixed, regression introduction means some previously working features are broken after the patch (because they were poorly tested). Early prototypes for automatic repair suffered a lot from overfitting: on the Manybugs C benchmark, Qi et al. reported that 104/110 of plausible GenProg patches were overfitting; on the Defects4J Java benchmark, Martinez et al. reported that 73/84 plausible patches as overfitting. In the context of synthesis-based repair, Le et al. obtained more than 80% of overfitting patches.\n\nOne way to avoid overfitting is to filter out the generated patches. This can be done based on dynamic analysis, or static code analysis of the generated patches. When a reference patch is available, a state of the art technique is to generate tests based on the patched version, such that the generated tests capture the expected behavior. While the sampling of the input domain by test generation is incomplete by construction, it has been shown to be effective at detecting overfitting patches, and even at finding human errors done during manual classification of patches.\n\nLimitations of automatic bug-fixing \n\nAutomatic bug-fixing techniques that rely on a test suite do not provide patch correctness guarantees, because the test suite is incomplete and does not cover all cases. A weak test suite may cause generate-and-validate techniques to produce validated but incorrect patches that have negative effects such as eliminating desirable functionalities, causing memory leaks, and introducing security vulnerabilities. One possible approach is to amplify the failing test suite by automatically generating further test cases that are then labelled as passing or failing. To minimize the human labelling effort, an automatic test oracle can be trained that gradually learns to automatically classify test cases as passing or failing and only engages the bug-reporting user for uncertain cases.\n\nA limitation of generate-and-validate repair systems is the search space explosion. For a program, there are a large number of statements to change and for each statement there are a large number of possible modifications. State-of-the-art systems address this problem by assuming that a small modification is enough for fixing a bug, resulting in a search space reduction.\n\nThe limitation of approaches based on symbolic analysis is that real world programs are often converted to intractably large formulas especially for modifying statements with side effects.\n\nBenchmarks \n\nBenchmarks of bugs typically focus on one specific programming language.\nIn C, the Manybugs benchmark collected by GenProg authors contains 69 real world defects and it is widely used to evaluate many other bug-fixing tools for C.\n\nIn Java, the main benchmark is Defects4J, initially explored by Martinez et al., and now extensively used in most research papers on program repair for Java. Alternative benchmarks exist, such as the Quixbugs benchmark, which contains original bugs for program repair. Other benchmarks of Java bugs include Bugs.jar, based on past commits, and BEARS which is a benchmark of continuous integration build failures.\n\nExample tools \n\nAutomatic bug-fixing is an active research topic in computer science. There are many implementations of various bug-fixing techniques especially for C and Java programs. Note that most of these implementations are research prototypes for demonstrating their techniques, i.e., it is unclear whether their current implementations are ready for industrial usage or not.\n\nC \n\n ClearView: A generate-and-validate tool of generating binary patches for deployed systems.

This process can help reduce the time and effort required to fix bugs, improve software quality, and reduce the likelihood of introducing new bugs during the fixing process.\n\nAutomatic bug fixing can be achieved through various techniques, including:\n\n1. Static code analysis: This technique involves analyzing the source code of a program to identify potential bugs and errors. Static code analysis tools can check for syntax errors, logical errors, and inconsistencies in the code, and can provide recommendations for fixing them.\n2. Dynamic code analysis: This technique involves analyzing the behavior of a program during its execution to identify bugs and errors. Dynamic code analysis tools can monitor the program's behavior, identify anomalies, and provide recommendations for fixing them.\n3. Automated debugging: This technique involves using software tools to automatically debug a program and identify the root cause of bugs and errors. Automated debugging tools can simulate the execution of a program, identify the point of failure, and provide recommendations for fixing the bug.\n4. Machine learning: This technique involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze the behavior of a program and identify patterns that may indicate the presence of bugs or errors. Machine learning tools can learn from the behavior of a program over time and provide recommendations for fixing bugs and improving software quality.\n5. Code refactoring: This technique involves automatically rewriting the source code of a program to improve its quality and reduce the likelihood of bugs and errors. Code refactoring tools can simplify complex code, eliminate duplicate code, and improve code readability, reducing the likelihood of bugs and errors.\n\nAutomatic bug fixing has several benefits, including:\n\n1. Increased efficiency: Automatic bug fixing can reduce the time and effort required to fix bugs, allowing developers to focus on other tasks and improving the overall efficiency of the software development process.\n2. Improved software quality: Automatic bug fixing can help ensure that software meets the highest quality standards, reducing the likelihood of bugs and errors and improving user satisfaction.\n3. Reduced costs: Automatic bug fixing can reduce the costs associated with manual testing and debugging, allowing developers to allocate resources more effectively and reducing the overall cost of software development.\n4. Faster time-to-market: Automatic bug fixing can help developers release software faster, improving the time-to-market and allowing businesses to stay competitive in the marketplace.\n\nHowever, there are also some challenges associated with automatic bug fixing, including:\n\n1. False positives: Automatic bug fixing tools may identify errors that are not actually bugs, leading to unnecessary work and time spent addressing non-issues.\n2. False negatives: Automatic bug fixing tools may fail to identify actual bugs, leading to software that is not of the highest quality.\n3. Complexity: Automatic bug fixing can be complex, requiring significant expertise and resources to implement effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, automatic bug fixing is a valuable technique that can help developers improve the quality of their software, reduce the time and effort required to fix bugs, and reduce costs.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Route 40 (MTA Maryland)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Route 40 is a limited stop bus route, identified as a \"QuickBus\", operated by the Maryland Transit Administration in Baltimore and its suburbs. The line currently runs from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Woodlawn to Middle River, both in Baltimore County, Maryland (on opposite sides) with selected trips terminating at Downtown Baltimore City Hall, passing through the west and east sides and the downtown area of Baltimore City. Service operates every 12 minutes during rush hour, and every 15 minutes at most other times during its hours of operation. The line serves the corridors of Edmondson Avenue in West Baltimore, including the communities of Edmondson Village, Allendale, and Rosemont, and Fayette Street and Eastern Avenue in East Baltimore, serving Patterson Park, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and Essex.\n\nUnlike a local bus, the 40 does not stop at every bus stop along its route. Rather, its stops are limited to certain locations of importance, including transfer points to other bus lines, major landmarks, and other busy intersections selected by MTA. In all, there are 32 stops along the route in each direction, which are all identified in printed timetables.\n\nHistory\nThe Route 40 started operating on October 23, 2005 as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a plan of then-governor Robert L. Ehrlich for streamlining and simplifying the Baltimore transit system. Unlike a rail line, this addition did not require any construction. The bus route was intended to resemble the proposed Red Line that is currently being studied for the Baltimore region.\n\nWhen it started operating, Route 40 ran from Security Square Mall to the Essex Park-and-Ride lot on Eastern Avenue. Weekday service operated every 10 minutes during rush hour and midday. On February 5 the following year, it was extended to Middle River and reduced to one bus every 12\u201315 minutes.\n\nOn June 10, 2007, the eastern layover was moved to a safer location at Old Eastern and Vincent Avenues. The western layover was moved to CMS on February 8, 2009 and the stop at Security Square Mall was moved from the parking lot of the mall to a point along Security Boulevard adjacent to the mall lot.\n\nQuickbus 40 PLUS Service\nEnhanced service for West Baltimore residents on the QuickBus 40 will begin October 25th, 2015.  The enhanced service will increase frequency and reliability on the line between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid in Baltimore County and City Hall in Baltimore City.\n\nCustomer will find additional bus trips added on west side between CMS and City Hall to enhance off-peak and weekend access to jobs.\n\nCriticism\n\nRoute 40 received a lot of criticism following its inauguration from riders, politicians, and the media. This criticism resulted in some changes being made to the route, schedule, and other details.\n\nThe service, which was projected to have a daily ridership level of 27,000, fell far short of that goal. Many riders waiting for other buses at common stops complained about seeing a lot of empty Route 40 buses. This resulted in its weekday frequency being reduced.\n\nLow ridership and unrealistic time allocation initially being built into the schedule resulted in poor on-time performance and buses clumping together. As one bus fell behind schedule while busy picking up passengers, the one behind it got ahead after stops had been cleared of waiting passengers, and ultimately caught up to the earlier bus. This left larger gaps between buses.\n\nFinancial resources needed in order to operate this service were obtained by cutting back on the amount of local bus service along common streets of operation, mostly on Route 23, which had its level of service cut by nearly 50% when Route 40 was introduced. This brought the number of local buses on these busy streets below the demand.\n\nThe service's original route had an eastern terminus at Essex Park-and-Ride lot, which was more than a mile short of the transfer point for some other lines, including Routes 24 and 55. An extension in February 2006 to Middle River allowed riders to transfer directly to those routes.\n\nOn the west side of the route, there is no designated Park-and-Ride lot allowing motorists to park their vehicles and catch the bus. Security Square Mall has not allocated any spaces for riders of Route 40, and an existing park-and-ride lot at the end of I-70 is not within a practical or pedestrian friendly walk of a bus stop.\n\nWhile rapid transit lines are generally modeled for commuter purposes, QuickBus is marketed only to those who do not own vehicles and depend on a neighborhood bus stop.\n\nTracking of buses\nAt 11 stops along the route, a new experimental system was installed late in 2006. Electronic signs at these stops, tied into a GPS system, indicate the expected time of arrival for the next bus, so riders do not have to rely on a less reliable printed schedule. MTA is considering implementing this system at many more bus stops along other routes in the future.\n\nThis system has been highly criticized. It is expensive, and money spent on it has not been spent on improving bus service around the Baltimore area. Even when fully in place, these signs will only be found at a small percentage of bus stops, and will not be useful to everyone.\n\nQuickBus Structuring\nOn December 21, 2006, Bus Route 40 was rebranded as \"QuickBus\" in order to better promote the service. Special pylons were added at selected stops to mark the locations.\n\nThe name \"QuickBus\" was synonymous with Bus Route 40 until August 30, 2009, when another QuickBus line, known as Route 48, started operation along the Greenmount Ave/York Rd corridor. The MTA had added two more QuickBus lines: Route 46 and Route 47 on August 29, 2010.\n\nReferences\n\nBus rapid transit in Maryland\n40\nTransportation at Johns Hopkins Hospital\n2005 establishments in Maryland", "machine_text": " Route 40 (MTA Maryland)\n\nRoute 40 is a major transit route operated by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) in the Baltimore metropolitan area. The route runs between the city of Baltimore and the surrounding suburbs, providing a vital connection for commuters and residents.\n\nHistory\n\nRoute 40 was established in 1973 as part of the MTA's efforts to revamp and modernize the region's public transportation system. At the time, it was known as the \"Baltimore-Towson Rapid Transit\" line, and it ran from the city's Inner Harbor to the Towson area, with limited stops along the way. Over the years, the route has undergone several changes and expansions, including the addition of new stops and the introduction of express service during peak hours.\n\nService\n\nToday, Route 40 operates seven days a week, with service every 15 minutes during peak hours and every 30 minutes during off-peak hours. The route begins at the Inner Harbor, where riders can connect to other MTA lines, including the Light Rail and Metro Subway. From there, it travels north along Calvert Street, passing through the downtown area and the Mount Vernon neighborhood.\n\nAfter leaving the city limits, Route 40 enters the suburban area of Towson, where it stops at several major shopping centers, including Towson Town Center and Towson Place. The route then continues north, passing through the communities of Lutherville and Timonium, before terminating at the Hunt Valley Mall.\n\nExpress Service\n\nDuring peak hours, Route 40 offers express service between the city and the suburbs. These buses operate on a limited-stop basis, bypassing several stops along the route and reducing travel time for commuters. Express service is available in both directions, with southbound buses running express from Hunt Valley Mall to the Inner Harbor, and northbound buses running express from the Inner Harbor to Towson Town Center.\n\nFeatures and Amenities\n\nRoute 40 is one of the MTA's most popular routes, with a ridership of over 15,000 passengers per day. To accommodate this demand, the MTA has implemented several features and amenities to make the ride as comfortable and convenient as possible.\n\nAll buses on Route 40 are equipped with air conditioning, comfortable seating, and wheelchair accessibility. Additionally, many stops along the route feature real-time bus tracking signs, which allow riders to track the location of their bus and plan their trip more effectively.\n\nIn addition to its regular service, Route 40 also offers several special services, including the \"Night Owl\" service, which operates late-night buses on weekends, and the \"Hopkins Shuttle,\" which provides transportation between the Johns Hopkins University campuses and the surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nImpact\n\nRoute 40 has had a significant impact on the Baltimore metropolitan area, providing a convenient and affordable transportation option for commuters and residents. By connecting the city with the surrounding suburbs, it has helped to reduce traffic congestion and promote economic development.\n\nIn addition, Route 40 has played a vital role in connecting residents with employment opportunities, educational institutions, and other vital services. For many people, it is a lifeline, providing access to the resources and opportunities they need to live and thrive in the region.\n\nConclusion\n\nRoute 40 (MTA Maryland) is a vital transportation route that has served the Baltimore metropolitan area for over 40 years. With its convenient service, comfortable amenities, and special features, it has become a popular option for commuters and residents alike. As the region continues to grow and develop, Route 40 will remain an important part of the transportation landscape, connecting people with the resources and opportunities they need to live and thrive.", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 9077910}
