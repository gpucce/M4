The laser beam was focused onto a small area of a fuel-rich gas mixture, resulting in the ignition of a photonic flame. We observed several new features of the photonic flame effect that have not been previously reported.\n\nFirstly, we noted that the photonic flame exhibited a distinct oscillatory behavior, with periodic fluctuations in intensity and size. These oscillations were found to be dependent on the laser pulse duration and the fuel-to-oxygen ratio of the gas mixture. By analyzing the oscillations, we were able to infer information about the underlying combustion processes and the interactions between the laser beam and the fuel-oxygen mixture.\n\nSecondly, we observed that the photonic flame could be sustained for extended periods of time, up to several minutes, by using a repetitive laser pulse train. This was achieved by adjusting the laser pulse duration and the interval between pulses. The sustained photonic flame exhibited a stable and consistent behavior, with minimal variations in intensity and size.\n\nLastly, we explored the use of the photonic flame effect for combustion control and modification. By manipulating the laser pulse parameters, we were able to influence the combustion process and achieve specific desired outcomes, such as increased flame temperature and reduced emission levels. Our results suggest that the photonic flame effect has potential applications in fields such as combustion research, industrial processes, and environmental control.\n\nOur work attempts to solve several problems associated with the photonic flame effect. Firstly, we aimed to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in the ignition and sustainment of the photonic flame. By exploring new experimental features, we were able to gain insights into the complex interactions between the laser beam, the fuel-oxygen mixture, and the combustion processes. Secondly, we sought to develop methods for controlling and modifying the combustion process using the photonic flame effect. Our results demonstrate the potential for using this effect to achieve specific desired outcomes in combustion processes.\n\nIn conclusion, our work presents several new experimental features of the photonic flame effect and provides a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Our results have important implications for combustion research and industrial processes, and highlight the potential of the photonic flame effect for combustion control and modification.

The MIPS instrument on Spitzer allows us to observe the cloud in the 24 \u03bcm band, which is sensitive to the thermal emission from dust grains, providing valuable information about the physical conditions within the cloud.\n\nOur methodology consists of analyzing the MIPS data in combination with existing optical and near-infrared data, using a range of techniques such as photometry, spectroscopy, and dust modeling. We use the photometry data to identify and classify the sources within the cloud, while the spectroscopy data allow us to study the physical conditions and chemical composition of the cloud. The dust modeling enables us to infer the physical properties of the dust grains, such as their temperature, size, and composition.\n\nOur motivation for this research is to advance our understanding of the early stages of star formation and the processes that govern the evolution of molecular clouds. By studying the Serpens cloud in detail, we can gain insights into the physical and chemical conditions that lead to the formation of stars and planetary systems, and how these processes vary between different clouds and environments.

Despite its importance, the CE evolution remains a long-standing problem in astrophysics, with numerous open questions regarding its timescale, efficiency, and impact on the subsequent evolution of the system.\n\nOur work, \"Common Envelope Evolution Redux,\" aims to provide a fresh perspective on this problem by revisiting the fundamental assumptions and physics that govern the CE evolution. We employ a novel, simplified approach that focuses on the essential processes driving the envelope exchange between the stars. Our methodology consists of a combination of analytical and numerical methods, allowing us to explore a wide range of parameter space and test various hypotheses.\n\nThe key idea behind our work is that the CE evolution is not just a simple matter of energy conservation, but rather a complex interplay between the binary's orbital dynamics, the structure of the envelope, and the mass and energy transfer between the stars. By isolating and examining each of these components, we uncover novel dependencies and feedback mechanisms that were previously overlooked.\n\nOur work attempts to address several long-standing issues in CE evolution, such as the discrepancy between observed and predicted CE durations, the role of eccentricity in the CE phase, and the impact of mass ratio on the envelope evolution. By providing a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the CE evolution, our research has significant implications for the study of binary star evolution, binary pulsars, and the formation of exotic objects such as black hole binaries and gravitational wave sources.\n\nThe motivation for our research stems from the recognition that the CE evolution is a missing link in our understanding of binary star evolution. By revisiting the fundamental physics of this stage, we hope to establish a firmer foundation for the study of binary stars and their role in the universe. Our work also underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in astrophysics, combining elements from hydrodynamics, stellar evolution, and dynamics to tackle complex problems in binary star evolution.

In recent years, the observatory has expanded its research scope to include the measurement of aerosol properties, specifically the aerosol phase function. This research is motivated by the need to better understand the role of aerosols in the Earth's climate system and their impact on atmospheric processes.\n\nThe aerosol phase function is a fundamental parameter that describes the way in which aerosols interact with light. It is a complex quantity that depends on the size, shape, and composition of aerosols, as well as the wavelength of incident light. Accurate measurements of the aerosol phase function are crucial for developing and validating models that simulate aerosol-climate interactions. However, such measurements are challenging to obtain, especially in the atmosphere, where aerosols are often present in low concentrations and are subject to complex spatial and temporal variations.\n\nTo address this challenge, we have developed a novel method for measuring the aerosol phase function at the Pierre Auger Observatory. Our approach leverages the observatory's existing infrastructure, including its suite of particle detectors and optical sensors, to measure the aerosol phase function in a range of atmospheric conditions. We have deployed a series of instruments, including lidars, radars, and spectrometers, to collect a comprehensive dataset of aerosol properties.\n\nOur results show that the aerosol phase function exhibits significant variability over the course of a year, with peak values occurring during the summer months.

The motivation for this study arises from the fact that many young binary systems are known to have circumbinary disks, and understanding the process of accretion in these systems is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of binary stars.\n\nOur approach is based on the idea that the tidal forces exerted by the binary stars on the circumbinary disk can lead to the formation of spiral density waves, which can in turn cause periodic accretion onto the stars. We use a combination of numerical simulations and analytical modeling to study this process.\n\nOur simulations reveal that the tidal forces indeed excite spiral density waves in the circumbinary disk, leading to the formation of accretion streams that periodically feed material onto the binary stars. We find that the frequency of these streams is correlated with the orbital period of the binary system, and that the accretion rate onto the stars is modulated with the same period.\n\nOur analytical modeling shows that this modulation is caused by the variation in the gravitational force exerted by the binary stars on the disk as they orbit each other. We find that the accretion rate is highest when the stars are closest to each other, and lowest when they are farthest apart.\n\nOur results provide important insights into the process of accretion in young binary systems with circumbinary disks. We suggest that periodic accretion may be a common feature of these systems, and that it may play a crucial role in shaping their evolution.

Firstly, we found that the SMBH mass function in early-type galaxies is significantly different from that in late-type galaxies.
